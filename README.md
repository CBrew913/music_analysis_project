   ## Project Overview
The topic we have chosen is to determine if there is a link between profanity in music and the change in popularity over the years.  The group has selected this topic in order to determine if there is a linear relationship between the use of profanity over time in music. The sources of data are music lyrics on a music lyric database and Spotify in order to use the meta data to determine top downloaded songs
      
  ### Objective
The main question to answer is if increased profanity in music lyrics increases the popularity of the song?  This information will help future song writers determine if using profanity will help the song sell or hinder it’s sales especially for up and coming artists.  The popularity index that we will use is based off of spotify. Each track has its own SPI calculated influencing the artist’s overall index. Yet, while the Popularity Index is majorly determined by recent stream count, other factors like save rate, the number of playlists, skip rate, and share rate can indirectly bump up or push down a song’s popularity index (1).  We will also break down the data by genre between dance pop, pop and other based on the top songs for the years 2010-2019.  The other avenue to discover is if over time the amount of profanity in a song peeks and then recedes over the years or if there is a steady increase. 

### Communication
The main communication source for this project will be through GitHub and Slack.  Our group has added extra meetings on Sunday's where we use Slack Huddle to combine our efforts to achieve the best projects.  The project manager will send out goals for each meeting in order to keep the group on track with the assignment.
