0,"Hey, Soul Sister",Train,"Hey, hey

Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you, and so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam, the smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided, you're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

Hey soul sister, ain't the Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo, the way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...tonight
Hey, hey

Just in time, I'm so glad you have a one-track mind like me
You gave my life direction, a game show love connection we can't deny
I'm so obsessed, my heart is bound to beat right out my untrimmed chest
I believe in you, like a virgin, you're Madonna, and I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo, the way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...tonight

The way you can't cut a rug, watching you's the only drug I need
You're so gangsta, I'm so thug, you're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see, I can be myself now finally, in fact there's nothing I can't be
I want the world to see you be with me

Hey soul sister, ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo, the way you move ain't fair, you know!
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do tonight,
Hey soul sister, I don't want to miss a single thing you do...tonight
Hey, hey

Tonight
Hey, hey

1,Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,"Obie Trice:
You won't see me in the hood
It's cause I'm doing this, man

Niggas, I'm still grinding, (yeah)
I'm still hearing those sirens,
I'm still getting chased by those lights,
Only the light's lime and my mic's on
And my time is none because I'm writing more,
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this buisness,
I'm here to eat, speak, until these hoes feel this, (for sure)
and I can't let y'all derail me, man,
I got young Kobe, homie, you gotta let go of Obie
cause Obie be back, (ain't goin' nowhere man...)
We got them craps going on
and that yak going on,
soon as a nigga touch down back from tourin',
It's whateva, put that on the chedda man,
but in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time,
chase cheese, rhyme till my voice give out,
this is it my niggas, this what we boast about,
Now I'm here so shut your motherfuckin mouth,
And show me love bitch..

Chorus:
I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life, (I dont love you bitch)
I wanna hold you in the morning,
hold you through the night

I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life, (We wanna love alcohol,
we wanna love guns, we wanna love money)
I wanna hold you in the morning,
hold you through the night.. (we don't wanna love bitches though)

Eminem:
There's a certain mystique when I speak,
that you notice that's sorta unique,
cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep,
and I'm still matic the way I flow to this beat,
you can't sit still, it's like tryin to smoke crack
and go to sleep, I'm strapped,
just knowing any minute I could snap,
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped,
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically,
it ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry,
it ain't even money, you can't pay me enough
for you to play me, it's cockamamie,
you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady,
my noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo,
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit 'n' kaboodle,
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it,
there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag,
you need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
you better love me... bitch

Chorus:
I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning,
hold you through the night

Obie Trice: and all the bitches say

I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning,
hold you through the night

50 Cent:
my buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name,
if it ain't about the flow,
it's about the stones and the chain,
if I was you, I'd love me too,
I roll like a bus, 9-11 porsce same colour as cranberry sauce,
I ain't gonna front, I thought R-Kelly was tha shit,
then we find out he fucking round with bow wow bitch,
niggas eatin popcorn, right, rewinding the tape,
now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin rape,
i'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes,
I thought L'il Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose,
(God Damn)
used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet,
then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats, (uh-huh)
that boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail,
that nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell,
my back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes,
and Big Ben taught Charlie B'more to deepthroat

Chorus:
I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning, (I luv'a burnish the monies,
the bunnies I just wanna hold you)
hold you through the night

I just wanna love ya for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning, (I just wanna love you)
hold you through the night."

You know you love me 
I know you care 
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there 
You want my love 
You want my heart 
And we would never, ever, ever be apart 

Are we an item? 
Girl quit playin' 
We're just friends, 
What are you sayin' 
Say there's another, and look right in my eyes 
My first love, broke my heart for the first time

Luda, when I was 13, I had my first love 
There was nobody that compare to my baby 
Ain't nobody come between us 
Or could ever come above 

She had me going crazy 
Oh I was starstruck 
She woke me up daily 
Don't need no Starbucks 

She make my heart pound 
And skip a beat when I see her in the street 
And at school on the playground 

But I really wanna see her on the weekends 
She know she got me dazing 
Oh she was so amazing 
And now my heart is breaking 
But I just keep on saying

Gotta really make sure that i'm sure

9,Only Girl (In The World),Rihanna,"We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don’t know
And don’t care (don’t care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take her to the telly and make her a victim

Patrón on the brain
Ball player in her face
They shake the spot
She’s just another cake

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He steady with a flock of 'em, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don’t care
Won’t care (won't care), all you do is keep me at home
Won’t let me go nowhere
He thinks because I’m at home
I won’t be gettin’ it on
And now I'm finding numbers
In the jacket pockets
Chicks calling the house non-stop
It’s getting out of control
Finally I can’t take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs
Saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don’t know
And don’t care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don’t be the reason
Don’t be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever
We gone forever"

So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes!
I left the jag and I took the rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please

I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail

Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, You've got me going around

Nothing to lose

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin’ gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try’na to creep a little sneak peek

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You’ll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

34,Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,Alicia Keys,
35,Sexy Bitch (feat. Akon),David Guetta,"I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard to pull sister Flo
Oh, my heart's in the basement
My weekend's at an all time low
'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
Yes she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

So I lay down a while
And I gaze at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all
It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say, Why didn't I say, no, no, no

She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that"

You gotta stand tall and cut away the ties
Drop walls and hold that head up high
The world is fast and youth ain't gonna wait
So grab a hold before it gets to late
Bare your soul and strip away the cold
Of withered life that's past so gray and cold
Cause all the pain that's filled these eyes you see
Was made to bleed just recently

Tears that made me,
Ashamed to be me,
But that gave me,
Strength to see me,
Made a spark that lit the dark that let me shine

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

'Cause it's time we come together
Be on because I'm bout to So do it now or never
I fall sleep to freeways far from here
Spend half the night just drinking beer
From this day on shall be the words
My flesh and bones shall make it hurt
Don't you test
I'll have to mess with you
Do my best so fuck the rest of you
One of these days you'll see I've always been right, right

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

And it makes me glad When I see the sun
And it makes me sad When you feel my one
And I thank my god Got a girl like you
And I thank my god Did you save me

Time to see, believe this in me
This pain that I feel deep inside

40,Something's Got A Hold On Me - Burlesque Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,Christina Aguilera,"So, what am I not supposed to have an opinion?
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a woman?
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back
Suddenly the target don't know how to act
So he does what any little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man to me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

Chorus:
This is for my girls all around the world(around the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down
Nobody can hold us down

Never can, never will...

So What am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause your words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing

If you look back in history it's a common double standard of society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get away with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make it change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

Chorus:
This is for my girls all around the world('round the world)
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth(repect your worth)
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Lil' Kim:
Now here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore

But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
cats take my ideas, and put they name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got Yo back

Your just a little boy
Think you're so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things

(This is for my girls)This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen not heard
So what do we do girls, shout louder
Lettin 'em know we're gonna stand our ground(stand our ground)
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Darling, rather be a poor woman living on the street, no food to eat
\\\'Cause I don\\\'t want no pie if I have to cry
\\\'Cause it\\\'s over when you said goodbye

All at once, I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Now that you\\\'re gone

From above, seems I had it all
But it doesn\\\'t mean anything
Since you\\\'re gone

Now I see myself through different eyes, it\\\'s no surprise
Being alone will make you realize
When it\\\'s over, all in love is fair

I shoulda been there
I shoulda been there
I shoulda, shoulda

All at once, I had it all

44,You Lost Me,Christina Aguilera,
45,Not Myself Tonight,Christina Aguilera,"Once upon a time there was a girl
In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
It hurt me to see the pain across my mother's face
Every time my father's fists would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
And every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK

I often wonder why I carry all this guilt
When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echoes of a broken child screaming please no more
Daddy don't you understand the damage you have done
For you it's just a memory but for me it still lives on

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so, so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back on yesterday

It's not so easy to forget, all the marks you left along her neck
When I was thrown against cold stairs
And everyday afraid to come home in fear of what I might see, next

(Chorus)
Bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
And I still remember how you kept me so afraid
Strength is my mother for all the love you gave
And every morning that I wake, I look back on yesterday
And I'm OK"

And that just ain't me

Cause I do know if I take that chance
Just where is it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Makes shorty all right with me
The way she getting low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asked for one more dance and
I'm like yeah
How am I supposed to leave?
And I said

Lil Jon: Luda!

Ludacris::
Watch out! My outfit's ridiculous
In the club lookin so conspicuous
And Rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
Forget about the game, I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get em in they birthday suits
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes!
I left the jag and I took the rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris feel cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leave em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

(CHORUS)

Ludacris:
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat to make ya booty go (clap)
Take that and rewind it back
Ursher got the voice to make ya booty go (clap)
Take that and rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make ya booty go (clap)
Take that and rewind it back

48,Castle Walls (feat. Christina Aguilera),T.I.,"[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 1 - T.I.]:
Ever had one of dem days you wish woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas getting they hate on
You walk by they get wrong you reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you get your hair? that next
They dont wanna stop there now they buzzin
Now you gushin, ambulance rushin you to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive, Just think it all started you fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way you could fuck around get shot die anyday
Niggas die every day all over bull shit dope money dice game ordinary hood shit
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blow I guess, from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 2 - T.I.]:
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Niggas start shit didn't next thing ya know we cappin
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that shit look back just laugh
Some shit still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
Cuz I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Justin Timberlake]:
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright

I miss the way it was before
no one even knew me
your eyes looked right through me
And I'm taking off your clothes
And you bloom like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I, I, I

And where the ocean meets the land
Is like the sliding of your hand
Prickles up my skin
And I can feel the changing weather
Ride alone along that coast
Sense memories of your ghost

Away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I, I, I

Deliver me, shut me up
Deliver me
Give into me, Release
Deliver me, deliver me

Through the airport corridors
In magazines in stores
If I see your face once more
Cause you know I can't ignore it
I recognize that pose
When you bloomed like a rose

I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you
I can't get away from you

The jeep gets broke on a blown out road
And I'm a tourist with a real light load
Will the government hold another month away
Missed our places where we always stay
(I can't get away from you)
Funny how we always pick these spots
Feeling like a have in the land of have nots
Sleeping on cots
Wishing that I had some tater-tots

And there's postcards written
I know I'll never send
The moment is gone and won't come again
I ride with souls who find no peace
Still I look to you to find release, find release, fine release

And the travelers return
Through the panic doors
(I can't get away from you)
Walking through the airport corridors
(I can't get away from you)
Welcome back now from the foreign shores
(I can't get away from you)
And I walk alone
And the ghost that I carry is yours
Tiger shark is azure blue
I hope the vision you had returns to you"

Niggaz say I'm too pretty to spit rhymes this gritty
Fuck y'all thought? Be dancin around in suits like I'm {Diddy}
Pretty, show niggaz how we run this city
Respect my name, Boogie nigga, stay in ya lane

I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks

You a industry bitch, I'm a in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six

repeat 1

I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uhh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta, and pours off like Screechie Don, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggaz stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she a go done de place
I'm like Marion Jones, what, who the FLUCK wan' race?
Listen, never trippin, never catch Brown slippin
Fuck, y'all only nice around mics like Pippen

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?

break it open let the goddamns walk out

Some convoluted axiom
Of the cube of x plus y
Equals itself divided by now

Where have you gone?

I been to south of highland falls before
I am a waiter in a furniture store
I'm in demand and i'm unsure why
I get to roll with the flyest of the fly

All my limbs are sticks and lines
My head's a point upon my spine,
I can't get no quadrilateral
I can't say half empty or half full now

And slapping at the angles of the shape you're in,
Left sleeve in velvet,
Right sleeve in sharkskin
All your laughs snapping like a dog bark
Left here looking for girls that glow in the dark"

But you wont let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
can't remember what you did

[Rihanna:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
so that I cant stay mad at
you
for too long that's wrong

[Ne-Yo:]
But I hate it...
You know exactly how to touch,
so that I dont want to fuss and fight no more
said I despise that i adore you

86,Marry The Night,Lady Gaga,"Driving home to be with you
The highway's dividing, the city's in view
As usual, I'm almost on time
You're the last thing that's on my mind
I wish I could tell you the way that I feel
But tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

No commotion, no screaming brakes
Most of it's over before I awake
From the ceiling, my coffee cup drips
While out my window, the horizon does flips
The worst part was hitting the ground
Not the feeling so much as the sound
Can't help but wonder if all this is real
'Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

Rubberneck traffic and passersby
And Slow Motion Walter, the fire engine guy
Stand around with their mouths open wide
I heard some idiot ask if someone's inside
With the Jaws of Life they tried and they tried
Nobody here can know how I feel
'Cause tonight is the night I fell asleep at the wheel

I guess it's over now
'Cause I've never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
I guess it's over now
'Cause I've never seen so much
Never seen so much, never seen so much
So much blood

In all the confusion there's something serene
I'm just a posthumous part of the scene
Now, I'm floating above, looking in
As the radio blares and wheels spin
I can see my face slump with a grin
And you, you're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind
You're the last thing on my mind

Suddenly, things become unsound
Stumbling on the shakey ground
Given arrows to shoot tornados down, shoo them down
To the ground

Saw a falling leaf,
Much to our surprise, a butterfly
And it sunk in this


HIDDEN SUN

Suddenly, things become unsound
Stumbling on the shakey ground
Given arrows to shoot tornados down, shoot them down
To the ground

Saw a falling leaf, a good luck, jump to grab
Much to our surprise, a butterfly
And it sunk in this induration, induration
In our lives

CHORUS
Inside ourselves
A hidden sun that burns and burns
It never does any harm to anyone

Shivering madly in the dark
Like an animal abandoned in the car park
And she held me, and the she showed me
The beauty of the human heart

Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 1 - T.I.]:
Ever had one of dem days you wish woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas getting they hate on
You walk by they get wrong you reply then shit get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you get your hair? that next
They dont wanna stop there now they buzzin
Now you gushin, ambulance rushin you to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Never mind that now you lucky to be alive, Just think it all started you fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way you could fuck around get shot die anyday
Niggas die every day all over bull shit dope money dice game ordinary hood shit
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually niggas don't know what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blow I guess, from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Verse 2 - T.I.]:
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy
Situation coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Niggas start shit didn't next thing ya know we cappin
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that shit look back just laugh
Some shit still look back just sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk shit all night
Cuz I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]:
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Ohh I've been travelin on this road too long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone

[Justin Timberlake]:
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright

while you stand there thinking about it.
There's nothing more that I can do
when you're hiding what you feel inside.
The closer we get the farther you run from the voice
that speaks from the heart.
The higher we climb the harder we fall

So don't leave me hanging'
don't leave me hangin' on!

Look over you shoulder then leave it behind

put all the heartbreak away.
We'll start all over
one step at a time

don't let the past take my place

It's heart over mind
heart over mind.

Time after time you say:
Give up
it's too hard for you to give in.
Don't let the hurt speak louder than love

don't live yesterday again.
Your mind's holding back what your heart's letting go

I'm fighting to help set you free.
I'm wanting you
you're needing me

So don't leave me hangin'
don't leave me hangin' on!

Look over your shoulder then leave it behind
. . .

Time heals the wounded and I know you will survive

Let's pick up the pieces
and put them together again
together again.

It is the night

Long lay the world
in sin and error pining
'till He appeared
and the soul felt it's worth!

A thrill of hope
the weary world rejoices,
for yonder breaks
a new an' glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night, when Christ was born

O night divine O night,
O night divine!

104,Titanium (feat. Sia),David Guetta,"
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here

baby, if you're still awake,
call me when you get this.

CHORUS:
I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still
So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you
And I know it's not right
And I guess I should try
To do what I should do
But I could fall in love
fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

besando mis labios,
acariciando mi piel,

And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed

And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even thought everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired

I was with him, he had 7 jack and cokes in him
They had platform heels, nose job bills
And some look like their ill with the fucked up grill
Supermodels on my 'D', 1 2 3
He said &amp;quot;2 for you, 2 for me&amp;quot;
Face like a saint, suckin' like a sinner
Cocaine makes you thinner, cocaine makes you thinner

I got supermodels on my 'D' (3x)


Like Roger Grimsby on eye witness news
Man he'll tell you the truth while he's singin' the blues
Just like gasarama on Avenue B
He'll check under the hood, man he'll teach you Tai Chi
He laughed and with a gesture bought a drinks for the girls
He said &amp;quot;You gotta have the love in this fucked up world&amp;quot;
You gotta have the love in this fucked up world
You gotta have that sweet, sweet love
That keeps you warm at night - ooo bop bop shabba
You gotta have that love, for the world
the world ain't what it's cracked up, get it cracked up to be - ha ha ha
Shoo be doo bop bop

You high-five your goodbyes and it leaves me nothing but blisters

So I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
I just wanna be one of the girls, pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys

So over summer something changed
I started reading 17 and shaving my legs
And I study Lolita religously
And I walked right in school and caught you staring at me

'Cause I know what you know but now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay, maybe one day but not until you give me my diamond ring

'Cause I don't want to be one of the boys, one of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be a homecoming queen, be a poster dream
Not one of the boys

I wanna be a flower not a dirty weed
And I wanna smell like roses not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're gonnna wanna
Make out make out make out with me

Kept� thinkin� I could never live without you by my side,
But then I spent so many nights thinkin� how you did me wrong,
I grew strong, and I learned how to get along,

And so your back, from outer space,
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon yourface,
I should've changed that stupid lock,
I should've made you leave your key,
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me,

Go on now go, walk out the door,
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore,
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye,
Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die,
Oh no not I, I will survive,
For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive,
I've got all my life to live; I've got all my love to give,
And I'll survive, I will survive,

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart,
And trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart,
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself,
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high,
And you'll see me, somebody new,
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you,
And so you felt like droppin� in and just expect me to be free,
Now I'm savin� all my lovin� for someone who's lovin� me,

Go now go, walk out the door,
Just turn around now, cause� your not welcome anymore,
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye,

You know i love to spend my morning time
Like sunlight dancing on your skin.

I've never gone so wrong as to telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can.

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again.

Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again.

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again..."

Half round my head
And on my face
Protecting me, protecting me
Afraid of your frown, don't change
For me expressions
A button undone
The earth that's on my back
And in my hair
Portraying me, portraying me
You're so clean, untouched
Like me experience possessed
She breathes so tence
Flexes her hand
Don't relax
Projecting me, projecting me....."

Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)

Never to return again but always in my heart

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said good-bye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, cause I won't say good-bye anymore

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right

Into every inch of you

But it goes straight to message
And I'm deep in the zone,

I don't know what you'd hide from me
All those times you said you'd die for me.

Don't go turning your back on me
Don't go walking away
Maybe you and I weren't meant to be
But don't go walking away.

I'll make it easy for you
And say the things that you can't
I know we're growing apart but it's alright.
Told you that this day would come
And you'd go off on your own
So don't you get second thoughts
'Cause the deal's done.
I try to be the bigger man and let go
But suddenly I start to wonder if there's more to the story.
It doesn't matter either way in the end
Because you'll fall in love again
And there were others before me.
Still it's so hard to say goodbye
But it's even worse to live a lie.

Don't go turning your back on me
Don't go walking away
Maybe you and I weren't meant to be
But don't go walking away.

Feel my heart beating fast for her challenge, may you try

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much for me, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watchin' me I feel somethin' down my spine
I play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)
I think you hopin' there's a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't? (we can't)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair

I know all you wanna know is answers
'Cause you could gimme what I need
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires lead?

I wanna know if you feel the way I do (I do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you (and you)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and you say can't (you can't)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man, unfair to Mr.Man
Unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr.Man, unfair to Mr. Man

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do (you do)
I think you hopin' there's a chance for me and you (and you)
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't? (we can't)

Sick and tired of all the after
Sick of trying to find a way to slide
Even though it always ends in laughter
It's never hard to tell when things are done
She looked into my eyes and the voice said run
She says that I'm a mess but it's alright
Whether it's two weeks, two years, or just tonight

You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high

I can find a reason that we should quit
I can find a reason to do it
I can find excuses for all my shit
She tells me just to work right through it

She's pretty, and I like her but she's too well
Cause I need red flags and long nights, and she can tell
It's not that it's my fault, it's just my style
Beginning with a look and then a smile

You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least until the price becomes too high

She don't need a thing, she don't need saving or a lay
She's got all her friends around, and you can hear them say
He's not into you, he's into the idea of
But little do they know that she's not through

You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least untill the price becomes too high

You can occupy my every sigh
You can rent the space inside my mind
At least untill the price becomes too high"

We always find our way home and never be decimated
I'm speaking from the heart we been the shit from start
An we gone grind to the end to our life re-starts
Come back in another life
An see you in a different light
An if I'm Superman babygirl you know you kryptonite
My only weakness its hard to defeat this
An even when I'm losing it feels so good
I can't complain you everything I aint
An compliment each other from the root to the base
Sitting on the top is where we always wanna stay
It a take a meotor to break us and that'll be tha day

206,Give It 2 U,Robin Thicke,
207,Foolish Games,Jewel,"You took your coat off
And stood in the rain
You were always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside
Looking in on you

You were always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair, you were
Fashionably sensitive but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway
With nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart, bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These... foolish games are
Tearing me apart
And your, thoughtless words...
Are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You were always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes
And talking over coffee
You philosophies on art, Baroque moved you, you loved Mozart
And you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

Teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands
Behind my back
Somewhere along the line I must've gone off track with you

Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself
And these... foolish games... are
Tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart...
And your
Thoughtless words...
Are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You took... your coat off
Stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that"

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man wants to speak Spanish
Como se llama,si, bonita,si, mi casa
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection

Hey Girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl
And everything so unexpected - the way you right and left it
So you can keep on taking it

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She makes a man want to speak Spanish
Como se llama, bonita, mi casa,
Shakira, Shakira

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise and keep on
Reading the signs of my body

And I'm on tonight

And I am starting to feel you boy
Come on lets go, real slow
Don't you see baby asi es perfecto

Oh I know I am on tonight my hips don't lie
And I am starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby, this is perfection
Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I am doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain

She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a 3rd world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
I need a whole club dizzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
No more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow

248,Shot Me Down (feat. Skylar Grey) - Radio Edit,David Guetta,"
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)"

I look and stare so deep in your eyes,
I touch on you more and more every time,
When you leave I'm begging you not to go,
Call your name two or three times in a row,
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain,
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame.

[Verse 2 - Beyonce]
When I talk to my friends so quietly,
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me,
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress,
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress,
The way that you know what I thought I knew,
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you,
But I still don't understand,
Just how the love your doing no one else can.

Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's
Got me looking so crazy right now (oh crazy)

I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this,

Millions never will
Do you know until you lose it
That it’s everything that we are looking for
When I wake up in the morning
You’re beside me
I’m so thankful that I found
Everything that I been looking for

I don’t wanna forget the present is a gift
And I don’t wanna take for granted the time you may have here with me

O ya quiza, yo no te importo mas

Asi como se fue otro vendra

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel
Amandote
Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener
A quien querer

El tiempo que te di
no fue tiempo perdido
yo me quede con lo mejor de ti
Me diste una ilusion
Un sueno y un destino
La fe que me faltaba por vivir
Si nuestro amor no da mas
Asi como se fue otro vendra

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Me quedo con la fuerza de poder tener

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Si ya se acabo tu amor

No fuiste solo uno mas
Algo muy mio vive en ti

Si ya se acabo tu amor
Te quedan las caricias que grabe en tu piel

268,Thinking out Loud,Ed Sheeran,"Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 2 ]
Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it

(Think about it)

[ VERSE 3 ]
The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

(Think about it)"

On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have

It's all over.. my face

And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
A double bed
And a stalwart lover, for sure
These are the riches of the poor
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face

A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
It's written all over my face

These are the riches of the poor

And I want the one I can't have

In the club a frump face,
It's kinda weird to me, since you're so fine

Ain't nobody love ya like I love ya
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya (Hey)
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch ya

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so is datin'
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

I could change your life

Girl....

(Pusha T)
Ma' whatcha wanna do?
I'm in front of you
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two
Or me and you put on a stage show
And the mall kids, that's how to change low
Point to her they say 'Wow, it's the same glow'
Point to me I say 'Yea, it's the same dough'
We the same type, you my air of life
You have me sleepin' in the same bed er'night

(Malice)
Do a robbery, you deservin' the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We could ride down
Pumpin' N.E.R.D in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
(I just love your....brain..)
Play number three, Joint called 'Brain'
Ma, take a hint
Make a swerve in the lane
The name Malicious
And I burn every track
Clipse and J Timberlake
Now how heavy is that?

Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl..
Maybe we'll fly the night away
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl...)

Ain't nobody love you like I love ya
(Can't love ya like I do)
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya
(Makes me trust ya like I do, hey)
Late at night I talk to you (hey)
You will know the difference when I --

(Break it down)

You know
I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
I never thought it would end up this way

It's kinda special right, yeah
You know, if you think about it
Sometimes people are just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

By the cruel force of nature from the blue
Instead of a night full of romance supreme
All I got was a runny nose and Agiatic flu

It's raining on prom night, my hair is a mess
It's running all over my taffeta dress
It's wilting the quilting on my maiden form
And mascara flows right down my nose because of the storm

I don't even have a corsage, oh gee
It fell down a sewer with my sister's ID

(talking)
Yes, it's raining on prom night.
Oh my darling, what can I do? I miss you.
It's raining real rain from the skies
and it's draining real menstrual blood from my thighs
over you, all over you. Oh dear god,
make him feel the same way I do right now.
He'll never want to eat me again.

What can I do? It's raining, raining from the skies
It's raining tears from my eyes over you
Oooooow, raining from the skies over you

I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)

The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We'll take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now move a little closer to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

(No , listen girl)

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
That love won't let me wait, no

He wears a face of the night--ooh, the perfect stranger
And I'm falling, ready or not
I don't think about it
Who knows where the wind blows?
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

My captive heart (He holds the key to these emotions)
My willing soul (Let me drown in this ocean)
And I carry the flame
And I play my part
As long as he's calling, calling
My captive heart

My captive heart... (My captive heart...)

Fire burns, so I've been told
But I like the way it feels
He has a wild passion that drives away the cold
And I know (And I know) his touch is real
I don't think about it
He leads and I follow
No doubt about it
I'll go where he goes

Something has brought me down but I won't give up hope
It's hard for you to cope when I'm around you

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

Alcohol, company I need to readjust
From this place of dust let's go drink tonight
And at the bar we'll drink 'til dawn and I'll pretend I'm dead
Whilst resting my poor head by the neon light

Let the sun break through
The cracks within my room
The grey sky fades to blue
It might wash away this gloom

The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us but we all die in the end
The birds will sing for us, the birds will sing for us
The birgs will sing for us but we all die in the end

I could fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel

Tomorrow will you want me still

I could fall in love with you

And I guess I should try
To do what I should do

fall in love with you
I could fall in love with you

Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

When I fell it was awful nice
Caught when not suspecting vice
The night was rife with wasteland life
You set my arm alight

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love
Barbed wire love snags my jeans
Barbed wire love...

Blasted by your booby traps
I felt the blow in both knee-caps
Your eyes did shine
Your lips were fine
And the device in your pants was out of site

All you give me is barbed wire love
All caught up in barbed wire love
Tangled up in barbed wire love
Throw my leg over barbed wire love

The kind of girl you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry
Her attitude is hotter than the earth's core
When she's around nothing else matters
Untouchable, she's got her own forcefield
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

She's the kind of girl you wanna marry
Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine
When she's around nothing else matters
Even if the sky was at a stand still
If I turn my back then someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Picture my life and my intention to ball
Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?
She changed your life - and your frame of mind
Sorry I hope what I'm saying is fine
We fuss but we take it one day at a time
If there's a fire you know that she'll lay in the line
I just, close my eyes and curve my mouth
Open my mind and words come out
You're eclectic, you're creative
You the picture girl I just painted
I got it, you name it, it's all paid for
Big castle on the sea shore, with the Willy Wonka decor
How this sound - Mr. and Mrs. Skateboard - P!

Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once, I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away
I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide?
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'till then, it will burn inside of me

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?"

With you

You get under my skin
I don't find it irritating
You always play to win...
But I won’t need rehabilitating oh no

Another planet, who's holding you down

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all
Wouldn't matter anyway

Don't change a thing, perfect as you are
Time has a way, time is all I've got
If my heart should shatter watching you
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

Heaven will be waiting when I fall into your open arms
I believe you'll find me there
You'll find me there

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it
I lose it all, if I lose it all

And if I lose it all
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool.
And he never gives an answer .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on his way, his head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices, talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make.
And he never seems to notice .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around"

running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

Let the river run
let all the dreamers wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem.

Silver cities rise
the morning lights the streets that lead them
and sirens call them on with a song

It's asking for the taking
trembling
shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

We the great and small
stand on a star
and blaze a trail of desire
through the darkening dawn

It's asking for the taking
Come run with me now
the sky is the color of blue
you've never even seen
in the eyes of your lover

Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog
your sons and daughters

It's asking for the taking
trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching

We're coming to the edge
running on the water
coming through the fog

Let the river run
let all the dreamers
wake the nation

Now screams through tha ruins
Through factory chainsAnd tha ghost of tha union
Forgotten remains
Disappear to their new homes
Tha knife tha thrust
Tha life burns to the raw bone
Tha blood on the floor of the tear is still dryin
Cover the spread sheets
Tha Dow Jones skyin
Cell block live stock
Tha bodies their buyin
Old south order
New northern horizon

Violence in all hands
Embrace it if need be
Livin been warfare

A fire in the masters house is set

Check tha high tech terror
Yes tha new order athletes
Peer into tha eyes of tha child already on trial
Armies rippin families apart
Get em on file
Convictions fit tha stock profile
All tha while films of dogs
Cutting through homes
Ripping skin from bones
Yes tha new millennium homes
Privatizing through private eyes
An era rising
Of tha old south order
New northern horizon

Although our love is still special

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over, starting over

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

It's been too long since we took the time
No-one's to blame, I know time flies so quickly

When I saw you standing there on the street
I found myself by your side
I started wanting you again
There's just no way to hide from that old
Loving You feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
It only seems to stop to start all over again with you.

I remember how you'd always been
That certain look in your eyes
Your not easy to resist
But I just walked on by
With that loving old feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Only seems to stop to start all over again with you
Loving you feeling with you
We were so close we were too far apart.

I gave you my love
I wanted your heart
Without yesterday haunting the way
Maybe we'd still be together
Sharing that loving you feeling again
It's really got me reeling again
Will it ever stop and not start over again
That loving you feeling again
No matter how much I try
This loving you feeling
It's taken such a long time to say goodbye
And getting over you is so hard to do
With this feeling loving you
That loving you feeling again..."

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I’m not your type, But I can make you sway.
It makes you burn to learn, You’re not the only one
I’d let you be if you put down your blazing gun.

[Rihanna]
Now you’ve gone somewhere else, Far away
I don’t know if I will find you (find you, find you).
But you feel my breath, On your neck
Can’t believe I’m right behind you (right behind you).

‘Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don’t mind
‘Cause we gone much further than I thought we’d get tonight

Sometimes you move so well
It’s hard not to give in.

[Adam]

You won't feel the warmth of friends around you
Say just words to me
Is it true that there is worth inside
So say just words to me

Your desires, only where there's fire burning

So I`ll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'til there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

A troubled cure

I used to be the same old way
When I decided to straighten up
I found it was a bit too late
Oh, that's when it all happened

I Get High, I Get High
I Get High on your memories

High on your memories

I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)
Highhhh (In background thoughout song)

[Verse One- Styles]
Everyday I need an ounce and a half
S.P.: the only flow'er that you know with a bounce in a half
Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get, high cuz I'm in the hood, the guns in around
It take a blunt just to ease the pain that humble me now
And I'd rather roll somethin up
Cuz if I'm sober dogg, I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin up
I get high as a kite
I'm in the zone all alone, muthafucka 'case I'm dyin tonight
So I roll em up back to back, fat as I could
You got beef with Styles P, I come to slide to the hood

[Chorus]
I Get High, high, high, high (Everyday)
I Get High, high, high, high (Everynight)
I Get High, high, high, high (All the time)

[Verse Two- Styles]
Ayo, I smoke like a chim-in-ney
Matta fact I, smoke like a gun
When a killa see his enemy
I smoke like Bob Marley did
Add to that, that I smoke like the Hippies did back in the 70's
Spit with the finishing touch
Get this, that I'ma finish you before I finish the dutch
I get high like the birds and the planes
I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush off the blunt and the walls, you understand
Like the M-5 pedal when its touchin the floor
I get high cuz fuck it, what's better to do
And I'ma neva give a fuck cuz I'm better than you

[Chorus]

[Verse Three- Styles]
I'ma smoke til my lungs collapse
I'm from a era where
Niggas cause terror over guns and crack
Where a dolla bill is powerful
I smoke weed cuz time seem precious, and I know what a hour do
High for a livin, gots ta ride for a livin
Wit my real gangsta niggas that'll die for a livin
Shit I get as high as I could
Cuz if you see things like I see things
Cuz I'ma die in the hood
Muthafucka understand its full service to you
I don't smoke the weed if it aint purple or blue
And you could name any rapper, if you want he could die
This is S.P. dump it in, you bitch I get high

I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Oh I'm not listenin'
oh I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
And I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An antisocial pessimist
but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and your
Intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, (Like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan, to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here (Ooh)
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
Oh tell them I'll be here
(Ooh) right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself
what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
Oh oh oh I asked myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh oh oh here, oh oh oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here Here (Oh oh, oh oh)"

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; [*screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
[*car tires squeal*] [*CRASH*]
.. [*brief silence*] .. [*LOUD splash*]

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you

I could fall in love with you

I can only wonder how
Touching you would make me feel
But if I take that chance right now
Tomorrow will you want me still
So I should keep this to myself
And never let you know

To do what I should do

make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
more than a feeling, that's the power of love

Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right
power of love that keeps you home at night

Chorus 1 :
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
that's the power makes the world go'round

Chorus 2 :
And it don't take money, don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
when it gets hold of you
and with a little help from above
you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
Can you feel it ?
Hmmm

Chorus 3 :
It don't take money and it don't take fame
don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
you won't feel nothin' till you feel
you feel the power, just FEEL the power of love

You feel the power of love
you feel the power of love

Through the good times and the bad
I'll be standing there by you....

Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're in heaven

We're in heaven"
597,Con Calma - Remix,Daddy Yankee,"Verse One: Puff Daddy

Now... what y'all wanna do?
Wanna be ballers? Shot-callers?
Brawlers -- who be dippin in the Benz wit the spoilers
On the low from the Jake in the Taurus
Tryin to get my hands on some Grants like Horace
Yeah livin the raw deal, three course meals
Spaghetti, fettucini, and veal
But still, everything's real in the field
And what you can't have now, leave in your will
But don't knock me for tryin to bury
seven zeros, over in Rio Dijanery
Ain't nobody's hero, but I wanna be heard
on your Hot 9-7 everyday, that's my word
Swimmin in women wit they own condominiums
Five plus Fives, who drive Millineums
It's all about the Benjamins, what?
I get a fifty pound bag of ooh for the mutts
Five carats on my hands wit the cuts
And swim in European figures
Fuck bein a broke nigga

Verse Two: Jadakiss (overlaps last two lines of Puff Daddy)

I want a all chromed out wit the clutch, nigga
Drinkin malt liquor, drivin a Bro' Vega
I'm wit Mo' sippers, watched by gold diggers (uhh)
Rockin Bejor denims, wit gold zippers (c'mon)
Lost your touch we kept ours, poppin Cristals
Freakin the three-quarter reptiles (ahahah)
Enormous cream, forrest green -- Benz jeep
for my team so while you sleep I'ma scheme (that's right)
We see through, that's why nobody never gon' believe you
You should do what we do, stack chips like *Hebrews*
Don't let the melody intrigue you (uh-uh)
Cause I leave you, I'm only here
for that green paper which lead you

Verse Three: Sheek

I'm strictly tryin to cop those, colossal sized Picasso's
And have papi flip coke outside Delgado's (whoo!)
Mienda, with cash flowin like Sosa
And the latin chick tranportin in the chocha
Stampedin over, pop Mo's, never sober
Lex and Range Rovers dealin weight by Minnesota (uhh)
Avoidin NARC's wit camcorders and Chevy Novas (uh-huh)
Stash in the buildin wit this chick named Alona (uh-huh)
from Daytona, when I was young I wants to bone her (uh-huh)
But now I only hit chicks that win beauty pageants (ahahaha)
Trickin, they takin me skiing, at the Aspens (c'mon)
Uhh, gangsta mental, stay poppin Cristal
Pack a black pist-al in the Ac' Coupe that's dark brown (whoo!)
Pinky-ringin, gondolas wit the man singin
Italian music down the river wit your chick clingin
to my bizzalls, player you mad false
Actin hard when you as pussy as RuPaul"
598,Find U Again (feat. Camila Cabello),Mark Ronson,"Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, oh, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I saw the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her ?

Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? Never !
Who said I'd lied because I never ?
I was detained, I was restrained
Broke my knee
Broke my spleen
(and then he really laid into me)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, who said I'd lied? - Cause I never, never
Who said I'd lied to her?

Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...
...I drank more

Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before

Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love

Set free me why don't you
get out my life why don't you
Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on

Set me free why don't you girl
get out my life why don't you girl
Cause you don't really love me, no, no, no,
You just keep my hanging on"

When you're lying here in my arms
Finding it hard to believe
We're in heaven

Oh, thinkin' 'bout our younger years
There was only you and me
We were young and wild and free
Now, nothing can take you away from me
We've been down that road before
But that's over now,
You keep me coming back for more

Baby, you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in Heaven
And love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're in heaven

Now, nothing can change what you mean to me
there's a lot that I could say
Just hold me now
Cause our love will light the way

Baby you're all that I want
When you're lying here in my arms
I'm finding it hard to believe,
We're in heaven
Love is all that I need
And I found it there in your heart
It isn't too hard to see,
We're In heaven
