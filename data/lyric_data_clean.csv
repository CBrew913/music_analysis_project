70,Just Cant Get Enough,The Black Eyed Peas,let us breathe lyricsintro speech  in a country where freedom is acclaimed on a constant basis lies the bedrock of hate slavery  ardent subjection based on color america the land where black people arent seen as people or respected as humans rather treated inferior  handled as beasts from the east  not with ease our inputs taken for granted our lives taken for granted our childrens futures doubted and our minds literally ousted 13 of peoples smaller than a small fraction but bigger than the big picture a group of people so small with an impact so vast youd think we was more than we are we really are  we always find a way from the brutal whip wielding slavery to segregated buses we made it all the way all the way from the fields to the house till we claimed our freedom made it out the house  made our way to the white house yeah see they seek to oppress but our heads are upheld i wonder how we manage to last with how they keep killing us but we wont digress  we wont be repressed weve shown you before we cant be oppressed  over a thousand unarmed black peoples was killed by cops in the year 2015 minorities killed in majority my hands are up i cant breathe i need love  rap prelude its lotta hate its a lotta prejudice a lotta bullshit a lotta racism the shit were subjected to i just cant understand it i cant i cant  phantom the thought or ideology of hating a fellow human based off the color of their skin that shit is a sin the shit is obscene  im here to shed light on what matters  let yall know that black lives matter its 2017  we gotta make a change we want peace  verse 1 its been way too many years that weve been enslaved now its time to air it out put it on display i don spent too many years of witnessing this pain now im fighting believing that we make a change i been losing my mind im drowning in my faith now im hoping that jesus can make me walk on water lord im gon need signs you hear us at this hour  im gon need yeezus to help this propaganda you might also like2020 election it wont even matter but dead or alive our opinions gotta matter i took a peek in my mind its plenty bullets flying through it  im way too educated i cant bullet proof it  every time we try to make a change they sabotage us when we do it anyways they annihilate us its the same white folks that claim that all lives matter but passed laws that made us slaves so we could call em masta  the ones that raped our wives  sold our sons away yeah that was years back then that shit aint go away cos it aint too long ago they burned out black bodies whipping hanging mutilating niggas just to raise their crops now they dont hang us they locking us away yeah they dont lynch us they shooting us on sight kill us more than diseases  cause our loss of life yeah it hurts way more to bring the past to light  but it aint gon change if we dont talk about it  it wont go away if we aint acting on it im eating blackeyed peas just asking wheres the love why they shoot us in the back just like walter scott why they take away our freedom making us insane then they label us as thugs for setting cars in flames ill take a page up out your book  read it right back quit being a bully  give my rights back  interlude you know weve got single mothers in the ghetto struggling to make a living  raise their kids and a prejudice motherfucker on

head shot from behind 4 in his right arm jonathan ferrell was shot 12 times at close range the cop kept shooting while he was on the floor yeah thats some crazy shit i cant relate to it  verse 2 when

202,"Ooh La La (from ""The Smurfs 2"")",Britney Spears,cady groves waiting game how a promising artist ended up back at the beginning lyricsthe 24yearolds dream came true when she found a major label home somehow everything went wrong inside a songwriters lost period and why shes still someone to watch three months ago cady groves was on rock road in wichita driving down the main drag in a crappy ford taurus when it suddenly hit her she pulled over to get an ice cream cone at a braums store hoping that would make her feel better but it didnt as she started to cry while sitting alone in the parking lot she grabbed her phone and called rani hancock her ar representative at rca records whom she considered a dear friend groves told her that she couldnt do it anymore  that is be a part of rca the label she had dreamt of joining since she was a child she wanted to be dropped the response she received was a heartfelt apology for her tumultuous stint on the label but no concrete answers as to why it had happened they wanted me to know that this was in no way my fault or due to my performance on anything groves tells billboard i kept every promise so why am i in a kansas parking lot afraid that my gas is gonna hit e why am i not good enough groves had moved to wichita a year before that parkinglot epiphany after spending the majority of the three prior years in los angeles waiting for her phone to ring she had signed to rca in 2010 and moved out to la months later but with bills to pay and no source of income decided to move into a house that her brother had renovated in kansas and search for a 40hour work week in late 2012 the only stipulation the job couldnt be somewhere that would risk her being recognized i almost got hired at a starbucks she says and i just couldnt do it because everyone i know in this town goes to starbucks and the second theyd see me theyd know i failed groves who is 24 years old was once a prize courted by every major label she has a collection of unique expertly written pop songs thousands of dedicated fans who appreciate her biting humor and midwest sensibility and a relentless work ethic that has beguiled some of the most celebrated producers and songwriters in modern pop music including savan kotecha one directions what makes you beautiful britney spears i wanna go and kristian lundin backstreet boys i want it that way n syncs bye bye bye during our first session both i and savan  instantly felt she had a great recognizable voice and personality says lundin the swedish legend who recently cowrote one directions single kiss you lundin has not done much mainstream production work in the past decade but for groves he willingly became a mentor for those who discovered her groves star potential was obvious and real but a few months ago when she and her manager officially cut the cord with rca after three years and one ep release she was done with her recording career with the permission of her past collaborators groves started posting a steady stream of yearsold demos online they werent demos of songs from her enthralling rca debut album because she had already resigned herself to never having that released commercially or even noncommercially instead they were outtakes songs that she had roughly finished and enjoyed but were deemed not strong enough to make the fulllength scraps the best she could offer for nearly 74000 twitter followers several of whom have tweeted her asking about the mysterious delay of her debut album at that point groves didnt think she would ever make music again i did the work and thats what i dont understand says groves and when you dont get to see that payoff for the work youve done for years its really frustrating after momentarily relinquishing her desire to become a pop star groves is back to believing in her abilities and is looking for a new chance manager stirling mcilwaine talks about meeting with new labels in the coming weeks and repeats the phrase cady 20 when describing the next phase of the singersongwriters career shes nervous about diving back in but is confident even cocky about what she can do to get it right the second time however she still has to figure out what went wrong the first time  growing up in oklahoma cities like marlow and lawton after her parents divorced groves would turn on christina aguileras genie in a bottle in her room and sing along from the inside of her closet because she didnt want any of her family members hear her attempts to match the melismas one day when her mother was outside cleaning the familys pool in the backyard cady marched outside and declared that she was going to be the next britney spears her mother responded no youre not i didnt want to be mean says groves mother carol petitt we all want as parents for our kids to have their hearts desires but i didnt want to see hers crushed youre gonna have to be able to provide for yourself but she was tenacious groves childhood was largely unhappy a rotating cast of stepfathers distanced her from her mother and most of her older siblings  cady is the youngest of seven children  told her that her voice was terrible and that she shouldnt pursue music wanting to become a songwriter but flirting with an interest in cooking she graduated from high school at 16 and attended the le cordon bleu college of culinary arts in scottsdale ariz from there she bundled up all of her possessions in a ford contour and bounced around the southwest residing in phoenix nevada and oklahoma at varying lengths of time feeling lost in every city and state while staying in oklahoma in the fall of 2007 groves got a call from her favorite brother casey inviting her to stay with him for a week at his house in kansas groves then 18 spent an incredible few days with her 28yearold brother watching the godfather and eating miniature chocolates and going food shopping at the end of the week she confessed that she still harbored the musical aspirations that she had had since she was little he said if you want to do something youre wasting time right now talking about being scared to do it groves recalls he gave me confidence we went out to eat that night and we took a picture together and i didnt know that that would be the last picture he ever took two days later casey was dead  the victim of a stillunresolved murder groves sank into a deep depression spending most of her days locked in an apartment in oklahoma writing the bleakest songs of her life when she pulled herself out of that stupor six months later groves did so quickly  leaving her apartment in the middle of the night driving to kansas city to live with her brother kyle for the summer of 2008 and setting up a makeshift studio in his basement where she could write lyrics and tinker with recording her vocals three months later cady went to live with another brother cody back in oklahoma where she mowed lawns all day and worked on her myspace page all night eventually groves wrote a full ep of songs titled a month of sundays  and still believing she couldnt sing went onto craigslist to find a vocalist who could prop up her words she found a girl online who was willing to record her songs and used her lawnmowing money to book some time at a studio in springfield missouri but the craigslist girl never showed up i felt like i had wasted so much money and the  bookers were like you dont have a bad voice just go sing the songs she says groves did the best she could in the missouri studio traveled back to oklahoma and got sent the finished songs back in three weeks i posted the first one says groves and the next day every major record label had contacted me on my myspace groves had reconnected with her family following caseys death but when her mother and brothers told her that the various label messages were hoaxes she stopped communicating with them about her career instead she found a friend and backer in hancock the senior vp of ar at rca who had worked with clive davis for over a decade at arista and j records and been courting groves to sign with the label while the burgeoning singer had been taking meetings in new york city  groves went with her gut inked with hancock and rca in early spring 2010 and in may embarked on her first national tour on the 2010 bamboozle road show alongside artists like third eye blind good charlotte and all time low ive never seen someone stand in front of a crowd of people and be able to capture them so instantly says guitarist ryan williams who began playing shows with groves in early 2011 everything was moving quickly for groves when the bamboozle trek wrapped in late june 2010 while her family was googling her name to find out that her spot on a national tour wasnt a practical joke groves had moved to los angeles determined to quickly write and record her first album standing on the santa monica pier groves gazed out at the pacific for the first time you look at the ocean and you cant control anything out there  its so much bigger than all of us she says it made me think if i want to make an impact on the world i have to have my songs be as big as this ocean to really move someone  the first songwriting attempts in los angeles were unsuccessful  groves says that she would send in songs and be told to keep writing a polite rebuff of the material she had already written groves was soon paired with some of the biggest swedish producers and songwriters in mainstream music to help extract her inner pop star kotecha carl falk nicki minajs starships one directions live while were young and lundin the latter of whom she worked with most closely all the while groves was ecstatic now writing with the collaborators of her childhood idols as an artist on the label of her childhood idols i remember telling my mom you dont understand  when i was a kid i had the christina aguilera single and it said she was on rca records and now my singles are gonna say that says groves at 21 she also fell deeply in love with a collaborator a 35yearold producer she had met at one of her first writing sessions in los angeles and began an intense monthslong relationship we had talked about moving in together and even getting married she says one day the producer was running late to a writing session and another producer at the studio casually mentioned that her secret boyfriend was married after one final interaction in which groves confronted the producer the two never spoke again feeling duped and heartbroken groves proceeded to rewrite all of the songs she and the unnamed producer had worked on together groves and lundin crafted an uptempo breakup single this little girl that was at once darkly sardonic and addictive punctuated by the line this little girl is capable of murdercause you hurt her the song premiered in august 2011 and previewed the this little girl ep released in february 2012 sam lansky times deputy culture editor heard groves debut ep at a manhattan listening session in october 2011 while serving as a blogger for muumusecom and was unexpectedly intrigued i was really startled by how great the music was and also by her transparency and what a compelling figure she was says lansky it was a lot more than what you got from hearing this little girl  there was a depth to her and her story and her willingness to share her story this little girl earned praise from pop blogs like popcrush justjared and idolator upon its release but the ep was actually supposed to be an album i had a finished album and i was going on tour with hot chelle rae  an ep is not the way i wanted to present these songs says groves according to the singer however rca thought it would be better to release this little girl as a single on a foursong ep and gauge interest before setting an album release date  a year and a half after signing with the label groves was ready to put something anything out for the fans she had started gathering online and on tour and begrudgingly backed the decision to release an ep led by her this little girl single but this little girl fizzled despite receiving a proper press push from rca and a music video that featured a cameo from blake shelton whom groves met on twitter the song did not chart and has sold only 89000 downloads to date according to nielsen soundscan the ep did even worse selling only 3000 copies to date the hot chelle rae tour came and went and without a hit single to give her first major label project some momentum groves went back to waiting for word on her debut album in pop you have to come out of the gate swinging says mcilwaine who started working with groves in late summer 2012 and also manages daughtry and kris allen you have to have a song that cuts through and doesnt just barely get into the top 40 you got to have some horsepower  in todays world you almost have to think about having a second single be successful after a first single does well in order to release an album groves was building a fan base on twitter passing the time by tweeting jokes that bordered on crude and that resulted in admonishments from her thenmanagement but she also had to shrug off questions about her album release and started to slip back into depression after settling into los angeles upon signing with rca groves became restless when her calls started going unanswered and began bouncing around the country again  returning to oklahoma then back to la then in nevada with her mother before finally landing back in kansas i had nothing to do all day she says the glimmers of hope were few and far between in the two years after the this little girl debacle her next single love actually was released nearly a year after this little girl in june 2012 but featured groves biggest chorus yet and another lundin arrangement that revealed its details with repeated listens love actually was included on the track list to the now thats what i call music 43 album as one of four now whats next bonus tracks in august 2012 around the time she decided to change management but without any radio play the single was quickly dismissed its current sales stand at 11000 downloads according to nielsen soundscan in early 2013 groves was brought out to los angeles to shoot a music video for forget you another new single that was more mature and evocative than love actually groves was told that forget you was going to be included on rcas upcoming soundtrack to the smurfs 2 and supported with a radio tour although her optimism had been waning the singer sensed that there was some enthusiasm for forget you from the label unfortunately the smurfs 2 soundtrack led by the littleplayed britney spears single ooh la la has sold 14000 copies since its release last july according to nielsen soundscan i think its fair to say that the smurfs 2 soundtrack totally underperformed says mcilwaine at that point the writing was on the wall for groves the radio tour for forget you had boiled down to a single performance at a water park named rock river rapids in derby kansas last july four more months of inaction followed with groves describing a scene in which her management was feverishly pushing for a renewed radio tour for a single forget you that had already fulfilled its titular promise out of options and patience groves called hancock in a parking lot and begged to cut ties while choking back sobs mcilwaine understood groves choice and finalized her departure from rca before the end of the year the singer is still attached to rcas parent company sony music entertainment through her sonyatv publishing deal i called up  tom corson says mcilwaine and said hey lets all be grownups here and realize that this probably isnt going to become a priority for rca and that you guys just have too many big records coming out can cady and i just go on our way and find her a new home and tom was a total gentleman about it he totally understood he felt bad about it but he was completely supportive of our decision to want to move on of course groves didnt think she wanted to move on after such an experience in midnovember she told her manager that her career was over mcilwaine advised the singer to take the thanksgiving and christmas break to think about her future and make sure her choice was final groves came back to him two days later with a changed mind i couldnt believe it when she said she was going to quit says petitt her mother but her heart wasnt ready to stop  in october 2011 just months before groves issued her only major label release to date rca records folded j records arista records and jive into one label it was only natural for some of the rosters smaller artists like groves to get somewhat lost in the shuffle during that time of onthefly transition but even some of the superstars on rca  including miley cyrus keha and miguel  have had to endure periods of reinvention often on different labels to achieve their current feats of fame over the courses of their careers the phenomenon of the clumsily executed first encounter with majorlabel life isnt really a phenomenon at all having and losing a major label deal in your early 20s is practically a rite of passage for most of the big artists who have broken out over the last few years  lady gaga bruno mars katy perry says lansky its sort of standard fare and i do think that that level of stardom could be in cadys future groves doesnt know what will happen to the album she recorded during her first year as an rca artist but grimly believes that it will never see the light of day even if she secures the rights from her former label i know that everyone around me doesnt want me to use  because they want me to make a new album she says and although those old songs sound slightly outdated they also possess the blistering songwriting style that this little girl and love actually hinted at without fully embracing songs like red handed revenge and same are more polished than any of groves properly released singles and a previously unheard enthusiasm for country music is flashed effortlessly in a majority of the tracks the collection of songs represents cadys own journey and expansion as a writer says lundin her country roots initially gave way to her bornagain love of pop she had been a closeted popoholic for years but progressed back towards country once enough pop was out of her system groves hasnt made peace with the fact that her album might be gone for good but she says shes happier than she has been in a long time the singer did find a job out of the public eye in wichita last august at the cocoa dolce artisan chocolate shop where she could utilize her culinary degree and make truffles for 40 hours a week in an unseen kitchen there were like eight people  in there says groves and they were all interested in what i did and wed listen to my songs as we worked everyone who hears those songs even strangers gets excited for me every day in wichita groves runs errands stops by the starbucks she declined to work at reads online articles and makes dinner she goes to church every sunday watches hdtv and livetweets new episodes of teen mom she has recently gone through a breakup and has leaned on family and friends while remaining candid about her feelings with her fans on twitter for groves social media remains a forum for both frank discussion about her past bouts of depression and an endless stream of taco bell jokes shes eager to write the next chapter of her music career with a new label home but groves hasnt written a new song in over a year groves admits that shes scared of losing them again of losing more pieces of herself in a way she still cant understand theres a huge fear  she says but if i dont do this what else am i good at i dont want to do anything else if i dont do this now when i have an opportunity ill never do this again if i end up sitting around for another four years at least ill be able to write and record a little bit longer at least its taking another step toward what i want instead of giving up im trying againembed

curving as the streets of san francisco utterly silent she fell asleep almost at once but kept waking from a nightmare about something in the mirror across from her bed nothing specific only a possibility nothing she could see when she finally did settle into sleep she dreamed that mucho her husband was making love to her on a soft white beach that was not part of any california she knew when she woke in the morning she was sitting bolt upright staring into the mirror at her own exhausted face she found the lectern press in a small office building on shattuck avenue they didnt have plays of ford webster tourneur and wharfinger on the premises but did take her check for 1250 gave her the address of their warehouse in oakland and a receipt to show the people there by the time shed collected the book it was afternoon she skimmed through to find the line that had brought her all the way up here and in the leaffractured sunlight froze no hallowed skein of stars can ward i trow ran the couplet who once has crossed the lusts of angela no she protested aloud  whos once been set his tryst with trystero the pencilled note in the paperback had mentioned a variant but the paperback was supposed to be a straight reprint of the book she now held puzzled she saw that this edition also had a footnote according only to the quarto edition 1687 the earlier folio has a lead inserted where the closing line should have been damico has suggested that wharfinger may have made a libellous comparison involving someone at court and that the later restoration was actually the work of the printer inigo barfstable the doubtful whitechapel version c 1670 has this tryst or odious awry o niccolo which besides bringing in a quite graceless alexandrine is difficult to make sense of syntactically unless we accept the rather unorthodox though persuasive argument of jk sale that the line is really a pun on this trystero dies irae     this however it must be pointed out leaves the line nearly as corrupt as before owing to no clear meaning for the word trystero unless it be a pseudoitalianate variant on triste  wretched depraved but the whitechapel edition besides being a fragment abounds in such corrupt and probably spurious lines as we have mentioned elsewhere and is hardly to be trusted then where oedipa wondered does the paperback i bought at zapfs get off with its trystero line was there yet another edition besides the quarto folio and whitechapel fragment the editors preface signed this time by one emory bortz professor of english at cal mentioned none she spent nearly an hour more searching through all the footnotes finding nothing dammit she yelled started the car and headed for the berkeley campus to find professor bortz she should have remembered the date on the book 1957 another world the girl in the english office informed oedipa that professor bortz was no longer with the faculty he was teaching at san francisco college san francisco california of course odeipa thought wry where else she copied the address and walked away trying to remember whod put out the paperback she couldnt it was summer a weekday and midafternoon no time for any campus oedipa knew of to be jumping yet this one was she came downslope from wheeler hall through sather gate into a plaza teeming with corduroy denim bare legs blonde hair horn rims bicycle spokes in the sun book bags swaying card tables long paper petitions dangling to earth posters for undecipherable fsms yafs vdcs suds in the fountain students in nosetonose dialogue she moved through it carrying her fat book attracted unsure a stranger wanting to feel relevant but knowing how much of a search among alternate universes it would take for she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves blandness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around and ahead of them this having been a national reflex to certain pathologies in high places only death had had the power to cure and this berkeley was like no somnolent siwash out of her own past at all but more akin to those far eastern or latin american universities you read about those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folklores may be brought into doubt cataclysmic of dissents voiced suicidal of commitments chosen the sort that bring governments down but it was english she was hearing as she crossed bancroft way among the blonde children and the muttering hondas and suzukis american english where were secretaries james and foster and senator joseph those dear daft numina whod mothered over oedipas so temperate youth in another world along another pattern of track another string of decisions taken switches closed the faceless points men whod thrown them now all transferred deserted in stir fleeing the skiptracers out of their skull on horse alcoholic fanatic under aliases dead impossible to find ever again among them they had managed to turn the young oedipa into a rare creature indeed unfit perhaps for marches and sitins but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in jacobean texts she pulled the impala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of telegraph avenue and found in a phone book the address of john nefastis she then drove to a pseudomexican apartment house looked for his name among the u s mailboxes ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door he had a crewcut and the same underage look as koteks but wore a shirt on various polynesian themes and dating from the truman administration introducing herself she invoked the name of stanley koteks he said you could tell me whether or not im a sensitivenefastis had been watching on his tv set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a watusi i like to watch young stuff he explained theres something about a little chick that age so does my husband she said i understandjohn nefastis beamed at her simpatico and brought out his machine from a workroom in back it looked about the way the patent had described it you know how this works stanley gave me a kind of rundown he began then bewilderingly to talk about something called entropy the word bothered him as much as trystero bothered oedipa but it was too technical for her she did gather that there were two distinct kinds of this entropy one having to do with heatengines the other to do with communication the equation for one back in the 3os had looked very like the equation for the other it was a coincidence the two fields were entirely unconnected except at one point maxwells demon as the demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold the system was said to lose entropy but somehow the loss was offset by the information the demon gained about what molecules were where communication is the key cried nefastis the demon passes his data on to the sensitive and the sensitive must reply in kind there are untold billions of molecules in that box the demon collects data on each and every one at some deep psychic level he must get through the sensitive must receive that staggering set of energies and feedback something like the same quantity of information to keep it all cycling on the secular level all we can see is one piston hopefully moving one little movement against all that massive complex of information destroyed over and over with each power stroke help said oedipa youre not reaching me entropy is a figure of speech then sighed nefastis a metaphor it connects the world of thermodynamics to the world of information flow the machine uses both the demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful but also objectively true but what she felt like some kind of a heretic if the demon exists only because the two equations look alike because of the metaphor nefastis smiled impenetrable calm a believer he existed for clerk maxwell long before the days of the metaphor but had clerk maxwell been such a fanatic about his demons reality she looked at the picture on the outside of the box clerk maxwell was in profile and would not meet her eyes the forehead was round and smooth and there was a curious bump at the back of his head covered by curling hair his visible eye seemed mild and noncommittal but oedipa wondered what hangups crises spookings in the middle of the night might be developed from the shadowed subtleties of his mouth hidden under a full beard watch the picture said nefastis and concentrate on a cylinder dont worry if youre a sensitive youll know which one leave your mind open receptive to the demons message ill be back he returned to his tv set which was now showing cartoons oedipa sat through two yogi bears one magilla gorilla and a peter potamus staring at clerk maxwells enigmatic profile waiting for the demon to communicate are you there little fellow oedipa asked the demon or is nefastis putting me on unless a piston moved shed never know clerk maxwells hands were cropped out of the photograph he might have been holding a book he gazed away into some vista of victorian england whose light had been lost forever oedipas anxiety grew it seemed behind the beard hed begun ever so faintly to smile something in his eyes certainly had changed and there at the top edge of what she could see hadnt the righthand piston moved a fraction she couldnt look directly the instructions were to keep her eyes on clerk maxwell minutes passed pistons remained frozen in place highpitched comic voices issued from the tv set she had seen only a retinal twitch a misfired nerve cell did the true sensitive see more in her colon now she was afraid growing more so that nothing would happen why worry she worried nefastis is a nut forget it a sincere nut the true sensitive is the one that can share in the mans hallucinations thats all how wonderful they might be to share for fifteen minutes more she tried repeating if you are there whatever you are show yourself to me i need you show yourself but nothing happened im sorry she called in surprisingly about to cry with frustration her voice breaking its no use nefastis came to her and put an arm around her shoulders its ok he said please dont cry come on in on the couch the news will be on any minute we can do it thereit said oedipa do it whathave sexual intercourse replied nefastis maybe therell be something about china tonight i like to do it while they talk about viet nam but china is best of all you think about all those chinese teeming that profusion of life it makes it sexier rightgah oedipa screamed and fled nefastis snapping his fingers through the dark rooms behind her in a hippydippy ohgoaheadthenchick fashion he had doubtless learned from watching the tv also say hello to old stanley he called as she pattered down the steps into the street flung a babushka over her license plate and screeched away down telegraph she drove more or less automatically until a swift boy in a mustang perhaps unable to contain the new sense of virility his auto gave him nearly killed her and she realized that she was on the freeway heading irreversibly for the bay bridge it was the middle of rush hour oedipa was appalled at the spectacle having thought such traffic only possible in los angeles places like that looking down at san francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridges arc she saw smog haze she corrected herself is what it is haze how can they have smog in san francisco smog according to the folklore did not begin till farther south it had to be the angle of the sun amid the exhaust sweat glare and illhumor of a summer evening on an american freeway oedipa maas pondered her trystero problem all the silence of san franciscothe calm surface of the motel pool the contemplative contours of residential streets like rakings in the sand of a japanese garden had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness for john nefastis to take a recent example two kinds of entropy thermodynamic and informational happened say by coincidence to look alike when you wrote them down as equations yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable with the help of maxwells demon now here was oedipa faced with a metaphor of god knew how many parts more than two anyway with coincidences blossoming these days wherever she looked she had nothing but a sound a word trystero a to hold them together she knew a few things about it it had opposed the thurn and taxis postal system in europe its symbol was a muted post horn sometime before 1853 it had appeared in america and fought the pony express and wells fargo either as outlaws in black or disguised as indians and it survived today in california serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual persuasion inventors who believed in the reality of maxwells demon possibly her own husband mucho maas but shed thrown muchos letter long away there was no way for genghis cohen to check the stamp so if she wanted to find out for sure shed have to ask mucho himself either trystero did exist in its own right or it was being presumed perhaps fantasied by oedipa so hung up on and interpenetrated with the dead mans estate here in san francisco away from all tangible assets of that estate there might still be a chance of getting the whole thing to go away and disintegrate quietly she had only to drift tonight at random and watch nothing happen to be convinced it was purely nervous a little something for her shrink to fix she got off the freeway at north beach drove around parked finally in a steep sidestreet among warehouses then walked along broadway into the first crowds of evening but it took her no more than an hour to catch sight of a muted post horn she was moseying along a street full of aging boys in roos atkins suits when she collided with a gang of guided tourists come rowdydowing out of a volkswagen bus on route to take in a few san francisco nite spots let me lay this on you a voice spoke into her ear because i just left and she found being deftly pinned outboard of one breast this big cerise id badge reading hi my name is arnold snarb and im lookin for a good time oedipa glanced around and saw a cherubic face vanishing with a wink in among natural shoulders and striped shirts and away went arnold snarb looking for a better time somebody blew on an athletic whistle and oedipa found herself being herded along with other badged citizens toward a bar called the greek way oh no oedipa thought not a fag joint no and for a minute tried to fight out of the human surge before recalling how she had decided to drift tonight now in here their guide sweating dark tentacles into his tab collar briefed them you are going to see the members of the third sex the lavender crowd this city by the bay is so justly famous for to some of you the experience may seem a little queer but remember try not to act like a bunch of tourists if you get propositioned itll all be in fun just part of the gay night life to be found here in famous north beach two drinks and when you hear the whistle it means out on the double regroup right here if youre well behaved well hit finocchios next he blew the whistle twice and the tourists breaking into a yell swept oedipa inside in a frenzied assault on the bar when things had calmed she was near the door with an unidentifiable drink in her fist jammed against somebody tall in a suede sport coat in the lapel of which she spied wrought exquisitely in some pale glimmering alloy not another cerise badge but a pin in the shape of the trystero post horn mute and everything all right she told herself you lose a game try all one hours worth she should have left then and gone back to berkeley to the hotel but couldnt what if i told you she addressed the owner of the pin that i was an agent of thurn and taxis what he answered some theatrical agency he had large ears hair cropped nearly to his scalp acne on his face and curiously empty eyes which now swiveled briefly to oedipas breasts howd you get a name like arnold snarb if you tell me where you got your lapel pin said oedipasorry she sought to bug him if its a homosexual sign or something that doesnt bother meeyes showing nothing i dont swing that way he said yours either turned his back on her and ordered a drink oedipa took off her badge put it in an ashtray and said quietly trying not to suggest hysteria look you have to help me because i really think i am going out of my head you have the wrong outfit arnold talk to your clergyman i use the u s mail because i was never taught any different she pleaded but im not your enemy i dont want to be what about my friend he came spinning around on the stool to face her again you want to be that arnold i dont know she thought shed better say he looked at her blank what do you know she told him everything why not held nothing back at the end of it the tourists had been whistled away and hed bought two rounds to oedipas three id heard about kirby he said its a code name nobody real but none of the rest your sinophile across the bay or that sick play i never thought there was a history to iti think of nothing but she said and a little plaintiveand scratching the stubble on his head you have nobody else to tell this to only somebody in a bar whose name you dont know she wouldnt look at him i guess not no husband no shrink both oedipa said but they dont knowyou cant tell them she met his eyes void for a second after all and shrugged ill tell you what i know then he decided the pin im wearing means im a member of the ia thats inamorati anonymous an inamorato is somebody in love thats the worst addiction of all somebody is about to fall in love oedipa said you go sit with them or something right the whole idea is to get to where you dont need it i was lucky i kicked it young but there aresixtyyearold men believe it or not and women even older who wake up in the night screaming you hold meetings then like the aa no of course not you get a phone number an answering service you can call nobody knows anybody elses name just the number in case it gets so bad you cant handle it alone were isolates arnold meetings would destroy the whole point of it what about the person who comes to sit with you suppose you fall in love with them they go away he said you never see them twice the answering service dispatches them and theyre careful not to have any repeatshow did the post horn come in that went back to their founding in the early 6os a yoyodyne executive living near la and located someplace in the corporate rootsystem above supervisor but below vicepresident found himself at age 39 automated out of a job having been since age 7 rigidly instructed in an eschatology that pointed nowhere but to a presidency and death trained to do absolutely nothing but sign his name to specialized memoranda he could not begin to understand and to take blame for the runningamok of specialized programs that failed for specialized reasons he had to have explained to him the executives first thoughts were naturally of suicide but previous training got the better of him he could not make the decision without first hearing the ideas of a committee he placed an ad in the personal column of the la times asking whether anyone whod been in the same fix had ever found any good reasons for not committing suicide his shrewd assumption being that no suicides would reply leaving him automatically with only valid inputs the assumption was false after a week of anxiously watching the mailbox through little japanese binoculars his wife had given him for a goingaway present shed left him the day after he was pinkslipped and getting nothing but suckerlist stuff through the regular deliveries that came each noon he was jolted out of a boozy blackandwhite dream of jumping off the stack into rushhour traffic by an insistent banging at the door it was late on a sunday afternoon he opened his door and found an aged bum with a knitted watch cap on his head and a hook for a hand who presented him with a bundle of letters and loped away without a word most of the letters were from suicides who had failed either through clumsiness or lastminute cowardice none of them however could offer any compelling reasons for staying alive still the executive dithered spent another week with pieces of paper on which he would list in columns headed pro and con reasons for and against taking his brody he found it impossible in the absence of some trigger to come to any clear decision finally one day he noticed a front page story in the times complete with ap wire photo about a buddhist monk in viet nam who had set himself on fire to protest government policies groovy cried the executive he went to the garage siphoned all the gasoline from his buicks tank put on his green zachary all suit with the vest stuffed all his letters from unsuccessful suicides into a coat pocket went in the kitchen sat on the floor proceeded to douse himself good with the gasoline he was about to make the farewell flick of the wheel on his faithful zippo which had seen him through the norman hedgerows the ardennes germany and postwar america when he heard a key in the front door and voices it was his wife and some man whom he soon recognized as the very efficiency expert at yoyodyne who had caused him to be replaced by an ibm 7094 intrigued by the irony of it he sat in the kitchen and listened leaving his necktie dipped in the gasoline as a sort of wick from what he could gather the efficiency expert wished to have sexual intercourse with the wife on the moroccan rug in the living room the wife was not unwilling the executive heard lewd laughter zippers the thump of shoes heavy breathing moans he took his tie out of the gasoline and started to snigger he closed the top on his zippo i hear laughing his wife said presently i smell gasoline said the efficiency expert hand in hand naked the two proceeded to the kitchen i was about to do the buddhist monk thing explained the executive nearly three weeks it takes him marvelled the efficiency expert to decide you know how long it wouldve taken the ibm 7094 twelve microseconds no wonder you were replaced the executive threw back his head and laughed for a solid ten minutes along toward the middle of which his wife and her friend alarmed retired got dressed and went out looking for the police the executive undressed showered and hung his suit out on the line to dry then he noticed a curious thing the stamps on some of the letters in his suit pocket had turned almost white he realized that the gasoline must have dissolved the printing ink idly he peeled off a stamp and saw suddenly the image of the muted post horn the skin of his hand showing clearly through the watermark a sign he whispered is what it is if hed been a religious man he would have fallen to his knees as it was he only declared with great solemnity my big mistake was love from this day i swear to stay off of love hetero homo bi dog or cat car every kind there is i will found a society of isolates dedicated to this purpose and this sign revealed by the same gasoline that almost destroyed me will be its emblem and he didoedipa by now rather drunk said where is he now hes anonymous said the anonymous inamorato why not write to him through your waste system say founder ia but i dont know how to use it she said think of it he went on also drunk a whole underworld of suicides who failed all keeping in touch through that secret delivery system what do they tell each other he shook his head smiling stumbled off his stool and headed off to take a leak disappearing into the dense crowd he didnt come back oedipa sat feeling as alone as she ever had now the only woman she saw in a room full of drunken male homosexuals story of my life she thought mucho wont talk to me hilarius wont listen clerk maxwell didnt even look at me and this group god knows despair came over her as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you she gauged the spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate an indianlooking kid hardly out of his teens with frosted shoulderlength hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots to dry speculation a hornrimmed ss type who stared at her legs trying to figure out if she was in drag none of which could do her any good so she got up after a while and left the greek way and entered the city again the infected city and spent the rest of the night finding the image of the trystero post horn in chinatown in the dark window of a herbalist she thought she saw it on a sign among ideographs but the streetlight was dim later on a sidewalk she saw two of them in chalk 20 feet apart between them a complicated array of boxes some with letters some with numbers a kids game places on a map dates from a secret history she copied the diagram in her memo book when she looked up a man perhaps a man in a black suit was standing in a doorway half a block away watching her she thought she saw a turnedaround collar but took no chances headed back the way shed come pulse thundering a bus stopped at the next corner and she ran to catch it she stayed with buses after that getting off only now and then to walk so shed keep awake what fragments of dreams came had to do with the post horn later possibly she would have trouble sorting the night into real and dreamedat some indefinite passage in nights sonorous score it also came to her that she would be safe that something perhaps only her linearly fading drunkenness would protect her the city was hers as made up and sleeked so with the customary words and images cosmopolitan culture cable cars it had not been before she had safepassage tonight to its far bloods branchings be they capillaries too small for more than peering into or vessels mashed together in shameless municipal hickeys out on the skin for all but tourists to see nothing of the nights could touch her nothing did the repetition of symbols was to be enough without trauma as well perhaps to attenuate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory she was meant to remember she faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony rollercoaster ride feedingtime among the beasts in a zoo any deathwish that can be consummated by some minimum gesture she touched the edge of its voluptuous field knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it that not gravitys pull laws of ballistics feral ravening promised more delight she tested it shivering i am meant to remember each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity its fine chances for permanence but then she wondered if the gemlike clues were only some kind of compensation to make up for her having lost the direct epileptic word the cry that might abolish the night in golden gate park she came on a circle of children in their nightclothes who told her they were dreaming the gathering but that the dream was really no different from being awake because in the mornings when they got up they felt tired as if theyd been up most of the night when their mothers thought they were out playing they were really curled in cupboards of neighbors houses in platforms up in trees in secretlyhollowed nests inside hedges sleeping making up for these hours the night was empty of all terror for them they had inside their circle an imaginary fire and needed nothing but their own unpenetrated sense of community they knew about the post horn but nothing of the chalked game oedipa had seen on the sidewalk you used only one image and it was a jumprope game a little girl explained you stepped alternately in the loop the bell and the mute while your girlfriend sang tristoe tristoe one two three turning taxi from across the sea  thurn and taxis you mean theyd never heard it that way went on warming their hands at an invisible fire oedipa to retaliate stopped believing in them in an allnight mexican greasy spoon off 24th she found a piece of her past in the form of one jesus arrabal who was sitting in a corner under the tv set idly stirring his bowl of opaque soup with the foot of a chicken hey he greeted oedipa you were the lady in mazatlan he beckoned her to sit you remember everything oedipa said jesus even tourists how is your cia standing not for the agency you think but for a clandestine mexican outfit known as the conjuration de los insurgentes anarquistas traceable back to the time of the flores mag6n brothers and later briefly allied with zapata you see in exile waving his arm around at the place he was partowner here with a yucateco who still believed in the revolution their revolution and you are you still with that gringo who spent too much money on you the oligarchist the miracle he died ah pobrecito they had met jesus arrabal on the beach where he had previously announced an antigovernment rally nobody had showed up so he fell to talking to inverarity the enemy he must to be true to his faith learn pierce because of his neutral manners when in the presence of illwill had nothing to tell arrabal he played the rich obnoxious gringo so perfectly that oedipa had seen gooseflesh come up along the anarchists forearms due to no pacific seabreeze soon as pierce went off to sport in the surf arrabal asked her if he was real or a spy or making fun of him oedipa didnt understand you know what a miracle is not what bakunin said but another worlds intrusion into this one most of the time we coexist peacefully but when we do touch theres cataclysm like the church we hate anarchists also believe in another world where revolutions break out spontaneous and leaderless and the souls talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort automatic as the body itself and yet sena if any of it should ever really happen that perfectly i would also have to cry miracle an anarchist miracle like your friend he is too exactly and without flaw the thing we fight in mexico the privilegiado is always to a finite percentage redeemed one of the people unmiraculous but your friend unless hes joking is as terrifying to me as a virgin appearing to an indian in the years intervening oedipa had remembered jesus because hed seen that about pierce and she hadnt as if he were in some unsexual way competition now drinking thick lukewarm coffee from a clay pot on the back burner of the yucatecos stove and listening to jesus talk conspiracy she wondered if without the miracle of pierce to reassure him jesus might not have quit his cia eventually and gone over like everybody else to the majority priistas and so never had to go into exile the dead man like maxwells demon was the linking feature in a coincidence without him neither she nor jesus would be exactly here exactly now it was enough a coded warning what tonight was chance so her eyes did fall presently onto an ancient rolled copy of the anarchosyndicalist paper regeneration the date was 1904 and there was no stamp next to the cancellation only the hands truck image of the post horn they arrive said arrabal have they been in the mails that long has my name been substituted for that of a member whos died has it really taken sixty years is it a reprint idle questions i am a foot soldier the higher levels have their reasons she carried this thought back out into the night with her down at the city beach long after the pizza stands and rides had closed she walked unmolested through a drifting dreamy cloud of delinquents in summerweight gang jackets with the post horn stitched on in thread that looked pure silver in what moonlight there was they had all been smoking snuffing or injecting something and perhaps did not see her at all riding among an exhausted bashful of negroes going on to graveyard shifts all over the city she saw scratched on the back of a seat shining for her in the brilliant smoky interior the post horn with the legend death but unlike waste somebody had troubled to write in in pencil dont ever antagonize the horn somewhere near fillmore she found the symbol tacked to the bulletin board of a laundromat among other scraps of paper offering cheap ironing and baby sitters if you know what this means the note said you know where to find out more around her the odor of chlorine bleach rose heavenward like an incense machines chugged and sloshed fiercely except for oedipa the place was deserted and the fluorescent bulbs seemed to shriek whiteness to which everything their light touched was dedicated it was a negro neighborhood was the horn so dedicated would it antagonize the horn to ask who could she ask in the buses all night she listened to transistor radios playing songs in the lower stretches of the top 200 that would never become popular whose melodies and lyrics would perish as if they had never been sung a mexican girl trying to hear one of these through snarling static from the buss motor hummed along as if she would remember it always tracing post horns and hearts with a fingernail in the haze of her breath on the window out at the airport oedipa feeling invisible eavesdropped on a poker game whose steady loser entered each loss neat and conscientious in a little balancebook decorated inside with scrawled post horns im averaging a 99375 percent return fellas she heard him say the others strangers looked at him some blank some annoyed thats averaging it out over 23 years he went on trying a smile always just that little percent on the wrong side of breaking even twentythree years ill never get ahead of it why dont i quit nobody answering in one of the latrines was an advertisement by acdc standing for alameda county death cult along with a box number and post horn once a month they were to choose some victim from among the innocent the virtuous the socially integrated and welladjusted using him sexually then sacrificing him oedipa did not copy the number catching a twa flight to miami was an uncoordinated boy who planned to slip at night into aquariums and open negotiations with the dolphins who would succeed man he was kissing his mother passionately goodbye using his tongue ill write ma he kept saying write by waste she said remember the government will open it if you use the other the dolphins will be mad i love you ma he said love the dolphins she advised him write by waste so it went oedipa played the voyeur and listener among her other encounters were a faciallydeformed welder who cherished his ugliness a child roaming the night who missed the death before birth as certain outcasts do the dear lulling blankness of the community a negro woman with an intricatelymarbled scar along the babyfat of one cheek who kept going through rituals of miscarriage each for a different reason deliberately as others might the ritual of birth dedicated not to continuity but to some kind of interregnum an aging nightwatchman nibbling at a bar of ivory soap who had trained his virtuoso stomach to accept also lotions airfresheners fabrics tobaccos and waxes in a hopeless attempt to assimilate it all all the promise productivity betrayal ulcers before it was too late and even another voyeur who hung outside one of the citys stilllighted windows searching for who knew what specific image decorating each alienation each species of withdrawal as cufflink decal aimless doodling there was somehow always the post horn she grew so to expect it that perhaps she did not see it quite as often as she later was to remember seeing it a couplethree times would really have been enough or too much she busrode and walked on into the lightening morning giving herself up to a fatalism rare for her where was the oedipa whod driven so bravely up here from san francisco that optimistic baby had come on so like the private eye in any longago radio drama believing all you needed was grit resourcefulness exemption from hidebound cops rules to solve any great mystery but the private eye sooner or later has to get beat up on this nights profusion of post horns this malignant deliberate replication was their way of beating up they knew her pressure points and the ganglia of her optimism and one by one pinch by precision pinch they were immobilizing her last night she might have wondered what undergrounds apart from the couple she knew of communicated by waste system by sunrise she could legitimately ask what undergrounds didnt if miracles were as jesus arrabal had postulated years ago on the beach at mazatlan intrusions into this world from another a kiss of cosmic pool balls then so must be each of the nights post horns for here were god knew how many citizens deliberately choosing not to communicate by u s mail it was not an act of treason nor possibly even of defiance but it was a calculated withdrawal from the life of the republic from its machinery whatever else was being denied them out of hate indifference to the power of their vote loopholes simple ignorance this withdrawal was their own unpublicized private since they could not have withdrawn into a vacuum could they there had to exist the separate silent unsuspected world just before the morning rush hour she got out of a jitney whose ancient driver ended each day in the red downtown on howard street began to walk toward the embarcadero she knew she looked terrible knuckles black with eyeliner and mascara from where shed rubbed mouth tasting of old booze and coffee through an open doorway on the stair leading up into the disinfectantsmelling twilight of a rooming house she saw an old man huddled shaking with grief she couldnt hear both hands smokewhite covered his face on the back of the left hand she made out the post horn tattooed in old ink now beginning to blur and spread fascinated she came into the shadows and ascended creaking steps hesitating on each one when she was three steps from him the hands flew apart and his wrecked face and the terror of eyes gloried in burst veins stopped her can i help she was shaking tired my wifes in fresno he said he wore an old doublebreasted suit frayed gray shirt wide tie no hat i left her so long ago i dont remember now this is for her he gave oedipa a letter that looked like hed been carrying it around for years drop it in the and he held up the tattoo and stared into her eyes you know i cant go out there its too far now i had a bad night i know she said but im new in town i dont know where it isunder the freeway he waved her on in the direction shed been going always one youll see it the eyes closed cammed each night out of that safe furrow the bulk of this citys waking each sunrise again set virtuously to plowing what rich soils had he turned what concentric planets uncovered what voices overheard flinders of luminescent gods glimpsed among the wallpapers stained foliage candlestubs lit to rotate in the air over him prefiguring the cigarette he or a friend must fall asleep someday smoking thus to end among the flaming secret salts held all those years by the insatiable stuffing of a mattress that could keep vestiges of every nightmare sweat helpless overflowing bladder viciously tearfully consummated wet dream like the memory bank to a computer of the lost she was overcome all at once by a need to touch him as if she could not believe in him or would not remember him without it exhausted hardly knowing what she was doing she came the last three steps and sat took the man in her arms actually held him gazing out of her smudged eyes down the stairs back into the morning she felt wetness against her breast and saw that he was crying again he hardly breathed but tears came as if being pumped i cant help she whispered rocking him i cant help it was already too many miles to fresno is that him a voice asked behind her up the stairs the sailor he has a tattoo on his hand can you bring him up ok thats him she turned and saw an even older man shorter wearing a tall homburg hat and smiling at them id help you but i got a little arthritis does he have to come up she said up there where else lady she didnt know she let go of him for a moment reluctant as if he were her own child and he looked up at her come on she said he reached out the tattooed hand and she took that and that was how they went the rest of the way up that flight and then the two more hand in hand very slowly for the man with arthritis he disappeared last night he told her said he was going looking for his old lady its a thing he does off and on they entered a warren of rooms and corridors lit by lowatt bulbs separated by beaverboard partitions the old man followed them stiffly at last he said here in the little room were another suit a couple of religious tracts a rug a chair a picture of a saint changing wellwater to oil for jerusalems easter lamps another bulb dead the bed the mattress waiting she ran through then a scene she might play she might find the landlord of this place and bring him to court and buy the sailor a new suit at roosatkins and shirt and shoes and give him the bus fare to fresno after all but with a sigh he had released her hand while she was so lost in the fantasy that she hadnt felt it go away as if hed known the best moment to let gojust mail the letter he said the stamp is on it she looked and saw the familiar carmine 8 airmail with a jet flying by the capitol dome but at the top of the dome stood a tiny figure in deep black with its arms outstretched oedipa wasnt sure what exactly was supposed to be on top of the capitol but knew it wasnt anything like that please the sailor said go on now you dont want to stay here she looked in her purse found a ten and a single gave him the ten ill spend it on booze he said remember your friends said the arthritic watching the tenbitch said the sailor why didnt you wait till he was gone oedipa watched him make adjustments so hed fit easier against the mattress that stuffed memory registera give me a cigarette ramirez the sailor said i know you got one would it be today ramirez she cried the arthritic looked around on his rusty neck hes going to die she saidwho isnt said ramirez she remembered john nefastis talking about his machine and massive destruction of information so when this mattress flared up around the sailor in his vikings funeral the stored coded years of uselessness early death selfharrowing the sure decay of hope the set of all men who had slept on it whatever their lives had been would truly cease to be forever when the mattress burned she stared at it in wonder it was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process it astonished her to think that so much could be lost even the quantity of hallucination belonging just to the sailor that the world would bear no further trace of she knew because she had held him that he suffered dts behind the initials was a metaphor a delirium tremens a trembling unfurrowing of the minds plowshare the saint whose water can light lamps the clairvoyant whose lapse in recall is the breath of god the true paranoid for whom all is organized in spheres joyful or threatening about the central pulse of himself the dreamer whose puns probe ancient fetid shafts and tunnels of truth all act in the same special relevance to the word or whatever it is the word is there buffering to protect us from the act of metaphor then was a 7 thrust at truth and a lie depending where you were inside safe or outside lost oedipa did not know where she was trembling unfurrowed she slipped sidewise screeching back across grooves of years to hear again the earnest high voice of her second or third collegiate love ray glozing bitching among uhs and the syncopated tonguing of a cavity about his freshman calculus dt god help this old tattooed man meant also a time differential a vanishingly small instant in which change had to be confronted at last for what it was where it could no longer disguise itself as something innocuous like an average rate where velocity dwelled in the projectile though the projectile be frozen in midflight where death dwelled in the cell though the cell be looked in on at its most quick she knew that the sailor had seen worlds no other man had seen if only because there was that high magic to low puns because dts must give access to dts of spectra beyond the known sun music made purely of antarctic loneliness and fright but nothing she knew of would preserve them or him she gave him goodbye walked downstairs and then on in the direction hed told her for an hour she prowled among the sunless concrete underpinnings of the freeway finding drunks bums pedestrians pederasts hookers walking psychotic no secret mailbox but at last in the shadows she did come on a can with a swinging trapezoidal top the kind you throw trash in old and green nearly four feet high on the swinging part were handpainted the initials waste she had to look closely to see the periods between the letters oedipa settled back in the shadow of a column she may have dozed off she woke to see a kid dropping a bundle of letters into the can she went over and dropped in the sailors letter to fresno then hid again and waited toward midday a rangy young wino showed up with a sack unlocked a panel at the side of the box and took out all the letters oedipa gave him half a blocks start then began to tail him congratulating herself on having thought to wear flats at least the carrier led her across market then over toward city hall in a street close enough to the drab stone openness of the civic center to be infected by its gray he rendezvoused with another carrier and they exchanged sacks oedipa decided to stick with the one shed been following she tailed him all the way back down the littered shifty loud length of market and over on first street to the transbay bus terminal where he bought a ticket for oakland so did oedipa they rode over the bridge and into the great empty glare of the oakland afternoon the landscape lost all variety the carrier got off in a neighborhood oedipa couldnt identify she followed him for hours along streets whose names she never knew across arterials that even with the afternoons lull nearly murdered her into slums and out up long hillsides jammed solid with two or threebedroom houses all their windows giving blankly back only the sun one by one his sack of letters emptied at length he climbed on a berkeley bus oedipa followed halfway up telegraph the carrier got off and led her down the street to a pseudomexican apartment house not once had he looked behind him john nefastis lived here she was back where shed started and could not believe 24 hours had passed should it have been more or less back in the hotel she found the lobby full of deafmute delegates in party hats copied in crepe paper after the fur chinese communist jobs made popular during the korean conflict they were every one of them drunk and a few of the men grabbed her thinking to bring her along to a party in the grand ballroom she tried to struggle out of the silent gesturing swarm but was too weak her legs ached her mouth tasted horrible they swept her on into the ballroom where she was seized about the waist by a handsome young man in a harris tweed coat and waltzed round and round through the rustling shuffling hush under a great unlit chandelier each couple on the floor danced whatever was in the fellows head tango twostep bossa nova slop but how long oedipa thought could it go on before collisions became a serious hindrance there would have to be collisions the only alternative was some unthinkable order of music many rhythms all keys at once a choreography in which each couple meshed easy predestined something they all heard with an extra sense atrophied in herself she followed her partners lead limp in the young mutes clasp waiting for the collisions to begin but none came she was danced for half an hour before by mysterious consensus everybody took a break without having felt any touch but the touch of her partner jesus arrabal would have called it an anarchist miracle oedipa withno name for it was only demoralized she curtsied and fled next day after twelve hours of sleep and no dreams to speak of oedipa checked out of the hotel and drove down the peninsula to kinneret she had decided on route with time to think about the day preceding to go see dr hilarius her shrink and tell him all she might well be in the cold and sweatless meathooks of a psychosis with her own eyes she had verified a waste system seen two waste postmen a waste mailbox waste stamps waste cancellations and the image of the muted post horn all but saturating the bay area yet she wanted it all to be fantasy some clear result of her several wounds needs dark doubles she wanted hilarius to tell her she was some kind of a nut and needed a rest and that there was no trystero she also wanted to know why the chance of its being real should menace her so she pulled into the drive at hilariuss clinic a little after sunset the light in his office didnt seem to be on eucalyptus branches blew in a great stream of air that flowed downhill sucked to the evening sea halfway along the flagstone path she was startled by an insect whirring loudly past her ear followed at once by the sound of a gunshot that was no insect thought oedipa at which point hearing another shot she made the connection in the fading light she was a clear target the only way to go was toward the clinic she dashed up to the glass doors found them locked the lobby inside dark oedipa picked up a rock next to a flower bed and heaved it at one of the doors it bounced off she was looking around for another rock when a white shape appeared inside fluttering up to the door and unlocking it for her it was helga blamm hilariuss sometime assistant hurry she chattered as oedipa slipped inside the woman was close to hystericalwhats happening oedipa saidhes gone crazy i tried to call the police but he took a chair and smashed the switchboard with it dr hilarius he thinks someones after him tear streaks had meandered down over the nurses cheekbones hes locked himself in the office with that rifle a gewehr 43 from the war oedipa recalled that he kept as a souvenir he shot at me do you think anybody will report it well hes shot at half a dozen people replied nurse blamm leading oedipa down a corridor to her office somebody better report it oedipa noticed that the window opened on a safe line of retreatyou couldve run she said blamm running hot water from a washbasin tap into cups and stirring in instant coffee looked up quizzical he might need somebodywhos supposed to be after him three men with submachine guns he said terrorists fanatics that was all i got he started breaking up the pbx she gave oedipa a hostile look too many nutty broads thats what did it kinneret is full of nothing but he couldnt cope ive been away for a while oedipa said maybe i could find out what it is maybe id be less of a threat for him blamm burned her mouth on the coffee start telling him your troubles and hell probably shoot you in front of his door which she could never remember having seen closed oedipa stood hipshot awhile questioning her own sanity why hadnt she split out through blamms window and read about the rest of it in the paper who is it hilarius screamed having picked up her breathing or something mrs maas may speer and his ministry of cretins rot eternally in hell do you realize that half these rounds are duds may i come in could we talk im sure youd all like that hilarius said im unarmed you can frisk me while you karatechop me in the spine no thank youwhy are you resisting every suggestion i makelisten hilarius said after a while have i seemed to you a good enough freudian have i ever deviated seriouslyyou made faces now and then said oedipa but thats minorhis response was a long bitter laugh oedipa waited i tried the shrink behind the door said to submit myself to that man to the ghost of that cantankerous jew tried to cultivate a faith in the literal truth of everything he wrote even the idiocies and contradictions it was the least i could have done nicht wahr a kind of penance and part of me must have really wanted to believe like a child hearing in perfect safety a tale of horror that the unconscious would be like any other room once the light was let in that the dark shapes would resolve only into toy horses and biedermeyer furniture that therapy could tame it after all bring it into society with no fear of its someday reverting i wanted to believe despite everything my life had been can you imagineshe could not having no idea what hilarius had done before showing up in kinneret far away she now heard sirens the electronic kind the local cops used that sounded like a slidewhistle being played over a pa system with linear obstinacy they grew louder yes i hear them hilarius said do you think anyone can protect me from these fanatics they walk through walls they replicate you flee them turn a corner and there they are coming for you again do me a favor oedipa said dont shoot at the cops theyre on your sideyour israeli has access to every uniform known hilarius said i cant guarantee the safety of the police you couldnt guarantee where theyd take me if i surrendered could you she heard him pacing around his office unearthly sirensounds converged on them from all over the night there is a face hilarius said that i can make one you havent seen no one in this country has i have only made it once in my life and perhaps today in central europe there still lives in whatever vegetable ruin the young man who saw it he would be now about your age hopelessly insane his name was zvi will you tell the police or whatever they are calling themselves tonight that i can make that face again that it has an effective radius of a hundred yards and drives anyone unlucky enough to see it down forever into the darkened oubliette among the terrible shapes and secures the hatch irrevocably above them thank you the sirens had reached the front of the clinic she heard car doors slamming cops yelling suddenly a great smash as they broke in the office door opened then hilarius grabbed her by the wrist pulled her inside locked the door again so now im a hostage oedipa saidoh said hilarius its you well who did you think youd been discussing my case with another there is me there are the others you know with the lsd were finding the distinction begins to vanish egos lose their sharp edges but i never took the drug i chose to remain in relative paranoia where at least i know who i am and who the others are perhaps that is why you also refused to participate mrs maas he held the rifle at sling arms and beamed at her well then you were supposed to deliver a message to me i assume from them what were you supposed to sayoedipa shrugged face up to your social responsibilities she suggested accept the reality principle youre outnumbered and they have superior firepowerah outnumbered we were outnumbered there too he watched her with a coy lookwherewhere i made that face where i did my internshipshe knew then approximately what he was talking about but to narrow it said where againbuchenwald replied hilarius cops began hammering on the office doorhe has a gun oedipa called and im in here who are you lady she told him how do you spell that first name he also took down her address age phone number next of kin husbands occupation for the news media hilarius all the while was rummaging in his desk for more ammo can you talk him out of it the cop wanted to know tv folks would like to get some footage through the window could you keep him occupied hang tough oedipa advised well see nice act you all have there nodded hilarius you think said oedipa then that theyre trying to bring you back to israel to stand trial like they did eichinann the shrink kept nodding why what did you do at buchenwald i worked hilarius told her on experimentallyinduced insanity a catatonic jew was as good as a dead one liberal ss circles felt it would be more humane so they had gone at their subjects with metronomes serpents brechtian vignettes at midnight surgical removal of certain glands magiclantern hallucinations new drugs threats recited over hidden loudspeakers hypnotism clocks that ran backward and faces hilarius had been put in charge of faces the allied liberators he reminisced arrived unfortunately before we could gather enough data apart from the spectacular successes like zvi there wasnt much we could point to in a statistical way he smiled at the expression on her face yes you hate me but didnt i try to atone if id been a real nazi id have chosen jung nicht wahr but i chose freud instead the jew freuds vision of the world had no buchenwalds in it buchenwald according to freud once the light was let in would become a soccer field fat children would learn flowerarranging and solfeggio in the strangling rooms at auschwitz the ovens would be converted over to petit fours and wedding cakes and the v2 missiles to public housing for the elves i tried to believe it all i slept three hours a night trying not to dream and spent the other 21 at the forcible acquisition of faith and yet my penance hasnt been enough theyve come like angels of death to get me despite all i tried to do hows it going the cop inquired just marv said oedipa ill let you know if its hopeless then she saw that hilarius had left the gewehr on his desk and was across the room ostensibly trying to open a file cabinet she picked the rifle up pointed it at him and said i ought to kill you she knew he had wanted her to get the weapon isnt that what youve been sent to do he crossed and uncrossed his eyes at her stuck out his tongue tentativelyi came she said hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy cherish it cried hilarius fiercely what else do any of you have hold it tightly by its little tentacle dont let the freudians coax it away or the pharmacists poison it out of you whatever it is hold it dear for when you lose it you go over by that much to the others you begin to cease to be come on in oedipa yelled tears sprang to hilariuss eyes you arent going to shootthe cop tried the door its locked hey he saidbust it down roared oedipa and hitler hilarius here will foot the billoutside as a number of nervous patrolmen approached hilarius holding up strait jackets and billy clubs they would not need and as three rival ambulances backed snarling up onto the lawn jockeying for position causing helga blamm between sobs to call the drivers filthy names oedipa spotted among searchlights and staring crowds a kcuf mobile unit with her husband mucho inside it spieling into a microphone she moseyed over past snapping flashbulbs and stuck her head in the window hi mucho pressed his cough button a moment but only smiled it seemed odd how could they hear a smile oedipa got in trying not to make noise mucho thrust the mike in front of her mumbling youre on just be yourself then in his earnest broadcasting voice how do you feel about this terrible thing terrible said oedipa wonderful said mucho he had her go on to give listeners a summary of whatd happened in the office thank you mrs edna mosh he wrapped up for your eyewitness account of this dramatic siege at the hilarius psychiatric clinic this is kcuf mobile two sending it back now to rabbit warren at the studio he cut his power something was not quite right edna mosh oedipa said itll come out the right way mucho said i was allowing for the distortion on these rigs and then when they put it on tapewhere are they taking him community hospital i guess mucho said for observation i wonder what they can observeisraelis oedipa said coming in the windows if there arent any hes crazy cops came over and they chatted awhile they told her to stay around kinneret in case there was legal action at length she returned to her rented car and followed mucho back to the studio tonight he had the onetosix shift on the air in the hallway outside the loud ratcheting teletype room mucho upstairs in the office typing out his story qedipa encountered the program director caesar punch sure glad youre back he greeted her clearly at a loss for her first nameoh said oedipa and why is thatfrankly confided punch since you left wendell hasnt been himselfand who said oedipa working herself into a rage because punch was right pray has he been ringo starr punch cowered chubby checker she pursued him toward the lobby the righteous brothers and why tell meall of the above said punch seeking to hide his head mrs maasoh call me edna what do you mean behind his back punch was whining theyre calling him the brothers n hes losing his identity edna how else can i put it day by day wendell is less himself and more generic he enters a staff meeting and the room is suddenly full of people you know hes a walking assembly of manits your imagination oedipa said youve been smoking those cigarettes without the printing on them again youll see dont mock me we have to stick together who else worries about him she sat alone then on a bench outside studio a listening to muchos colleague rabbit warren spin records mucho came downstairs carrying his copy a serenity about him shed never seen he used to hunch his shoulders and have a rapid eye blink rate and both now were gone wait he smiled and dwindled down the hall she scrutinized him from behind trying to see iridescences auras they had some time before he was on they drove downtown to a pizzeria and bar and faced each other through the fluted gold lens of a beer pitcher how are you getting on with metzger he said theres nothing she said not any more at least said mucho i could tell that when you were talking into the mike thats pretty good oedipa said she couldnt figure the expression on his face its extraordinary said mucho everythings been wait listen she heard nothing unusual there are seventeen violins on that cut mucho said and one of them i cant tell where he was because its monaural here damn it dawned on her that he was talking about the muzak it has been seeping in in its subliminal unidentifiable way since theyd entered the place all strings reeds muted brass what is it she said feeling anxious his e string mucho said its a few cycles sharp  he cant be a studio musician do you think somebody could do the dinosaur bone bit with that one string oed with just his set of notes on that cut figure out what his ear is like and then the musculature of his hands and arms and eventually the entire man god wouldnt that be wonderful why should you want to he was real that wasnt synthetic they could dispense with live musicians if they wanted put together all the right overtones at the right power levels so itd come out like a violin like i  he hesitated before breaking into a radiant smile youll think im crazy oed but i can do the same thing in reverse listen to anything and take it apart again spectrum analysis in my head i can break down chords and timbres and words too into all the basic frequencies and harmonics with all their different loudnesss and listen to them each pure tone but all at once how can you do that its like i have a separate channel for each one mucho said excited and if i need more i just expand add on what i need i dont know how it works but lately i can do it with people talking too say rich chocolaty goodness rich chocolaty goodness said oedipa yes said mucho and fell silent well what oedipa asked after a couple minutes with an edge to her voice i noticed it the other night hearing rabbit do a commercial no matter whos talking the different power spectra are the same give or take a small percentage so you and rabbit have something in common now more than that everybody who says the same words is the same person if the spectra are the same only they happen differently in time you dig but the time is arbitrary you pick your zero point anywhere you want that way you can shuffle each persons time line sideways till they all coincide then youd have this big god maybe a couple hundred million chorus saying rich chocolaty goodness together and it would all be the same voice mucho she said impatient but also flirting with a wild suspicion is this what punch means when he says youre coming on like a whole roomful of people thats what i am said mucho right everybody is he gazed at her perhaps having had his vision of consensus as others do orgasms face now smooth amiable at peace she didnt know him panic started to climb out of a dark region in her head whenever i put the headset on now hed continued i really do understand what i find there when those kids sing about she loves you yeah well you know she does shes any number of people all over the world back through time different colors sizes ages shapes distances from death but she loves and the you is everybody and herself oedipa the human voice you know its a flipping miracle his eyes brimming reflecting the color of beer baby she said helpless knowing of nothing she could do for this and afraid for him he put a little clear plastic bottle on the table between them she stared at the pills in it and then understood thats lsd she said mucho smiled back whered you get it knowinghilarius he broadened his program to include husbandslook then oedipa said trying to be businesslike how long has it been that youve been on this he honestly couldnt rememberbut there may be a chance youre not addicted yet oed looking at her puzzled you dont get addicted its not like youre some hophead you take it because its good because you hear and see things even smell them taste like you never could because the world is so abundant no end to it baby youre an antenna sending your pattern out across a million lives a night and theyre your lives too he had this patient motherly look now oedipa wanted to hit him in the mouth the songs its not just that they say something they are something in the pure sound something new and my dreams have changed oh goodo flipping her hair a couple times furious no nightmares anymore fine so your latest little friend whoever she is she really made out at that age you know they need all the sleep they can get theres no girl oed let me tell you the bad dream that i used to have all the time about the car lot remember that i could never even tell you about it but i can now it doesnt bother me anymore it was only that sign in the lot thats what scared me in the dream id be going about a normal days business and suddenly with no warning thered be the sign we were a member of the national automobile dealers association nada just this creaking metal sign that said nada nada against the blue sky i used to wake up hollering she remembered now he would never be spooked again not as long as he had the pills she could not quite get it into her head that the day shed left him for san francisco was the day shed seen mucho for the last time so much of him already had dissipated oh listen he was saying oed dig but she couldnt even tell what the tune was when it was time for him to go back to the station he nodded toward the pills you could have thoseshe shook her head noyoure going back to san franciscotonight yes but the copsill be a fugitive later she couldnt remember if theyd said anything else at the station they kissed goodbye all of them as mucho walked away he was whistling something complicated twelvetone oedipa sat with her forehead resting on the steering wheel and remembered that she hadnt asked him about the trystero cancellation on his letter but by then it was too late to make any differenceembed

422,Wish That You Were Here - From Miss Peregrines Home for Peculiar Children Original Motion Picture,Florence + The Machine,the vampire his kith and kin  chapter 3 lyricschapter iii the traits and practice of vampirism it was generally supposed that all suicides might after death become vampires and this was easily extended to those who met with any violent or sudden death mr lawson tells us that there persists a tradition in maina where the vendetta is still maintained that a man whose murder has not been avenged is liable to become a vrykolakas the mainotes who derive their name from the place maina near cape taenaron matapan even yet preserve many of the customs and characteristics of their ancestors and historically are known to be of a more pure greek descent than the inhabitants of any other district indeed the peninsula which thrusts into the sea the headland of taenaron has both social and religious customs of its own the population is distributed into small villages while here and there a white fortress will denote the residence of a chief a traveller writing in 1858 remarks the maina country is wild and beautiful singularly well cultivated considering the difficulties to be surmounted and producing crops that put to shade the rich plains of argos and arcadia whilst the interesting mountain people exercise the highland virtues of hospitality and independance to an extent unknown in the low countries it has been said that the last traveller who saw maina while retaining some remains of its primitive cateran glories was lord carnarvon who in 1839 explored the morea and has left us an extraordinarily interesting account of his journey the population of this district continued the worship of the pagan deities for full five hundred years after the rest of the roman empire had embraced christianity and they were not finally converted until the reign of the vigorous emperor basil i 867886 gibbon described them as a domestic and perhaps original race who in some degree might derive their blood from the muchinjured helotes and even yet p 141 they boast of their descent from the ancient spartans whilst the histories of leonidas and lycurgus who figure partly as saints and partly as gallant brigands are still retold round the winter fireside the whole district including kaka voulia the land of evil counsel is formed by the hummocks and escarpments of mount taygetos and with the exception of a long strip of coast line which the venetians called bassa maina it is steep and hilly and for the most part barren the conquest of the morea was completed by mahomet ii in 14561460 but maina could never be thoroughly subdued and its inhabitants remained as entirely independent as were the highlanders before culloden as has been remarked ancient traditions still persevere and among these customs not the least obstinate is the vendetta a man who has been murdered is unable to rest in his grave until he has been avenged accordingly he issues forth as a vampire thirsting for the blood of his enemy in order to bring about his physical dissolution and to secure his repose it is necessary for the next of kin to slay the murderer or at least some near relative of the murderer unless this is done the man upon whom the duty of avenging blood devolves is banned by the curse of the dead and if so be that he is himself cut off before he can satify the desires of the deceased the curse will yet cling to him even in death and he too must become a vampire it should be remarked that this view of bloodguilt is found in the attic dramatists and is in fact the mainspring of the whole story of orestes in the tragedy of this name by euripides tyndareus the father of clytemnestra remonstrates very reasonably and indeed unanswerably with orestes but the hero replies and argues that if he has not avenged his father had not his hates erinyes haunted me again in the choephoroe of aeschylus orestes pursues the same idea saying that unless he avenges his father a stern duty which has devolved upon him lie will be punished in turn by the avengers of his fathers wrongs it may be remarked that in maina today no recourse must be had to law for such cases nor must the injured person satisfy himself by calling upon the aid of the police to do this were incredibly base the subterfuge of a recreant and a craven even if it be a lifes whole work a man is expected either secretly p 142 or by an open attack to slay the murderer of his relative and he is highly applauded when he has accomplished this pious deed it must be appreciated that he is regarded as herein directed and inspired by the dead man who returns from his grave as a vampire craving for blood even if no other motive or incentive prevailed in spite of natural shrinking and may be even cowardice a man would undoubtedly prefer to shed blood for blood especially when this might be done in secrecy or by craft rather than run the terrible risk of himself becoming a vampire finding no rest in the grave but returning to haunt and persecute even those who were most dear to him an unclean thing accursed of god a foul goblin of dread most hateful to man so great is the horror which the act of suicide although considered admirable in the decadence of greece and rome inspires in every man of sane mind that it is not at all surprising it should be deemed that the unfortunate wretches who have destroyed themselves become vampires after death according to the zoroastrian creed suicide is a most fearful crime and is classed among the margarzan the abominable offences aristotle in his ethics v xv terms suicide a sin against the state and as cicero tells us pythagoras forbade men to depart from their guard or sentrygo in life without an order from their commandingofficer who is god uetatque pythagoras iniussu imperatoris id est dei de praesidio et statione uitae decedere de senectute xx 73 the highest pagan argument against suicide will be found in platos phaedo 61e62e but it is drowned in the mighty voice of the great saint of hippo which peals in no unwavering tones down the centuries for if it be not lawful for a private man to kill any man however guilty unless the law have granted a special allowance for it theft surely whosoever kills himself is guilty of homicide and so much the more guilty doth that killing of himself make himself by how much the more guiltless he was in that cause for which he killed himself for if the act of judas be worthily detested and yet the truth saith that by hanging of himself he did rather augment than expiate the guilt of his wicked treachery because his despair of gods mercy in his damnable repentance left no place in his soul for saving repentance how much more ought he to p 143 forbear from being cause of his own death that hath no guilt in him worthy of such a punishment as death for judas in hanging himself hanged but a wicked man and died guilty not only of christs death but of his own also adding the wickedness of being his own death to that other wickedness of his for which he died de ciuitate dei i xvii it may be well very briefly to present the teaching of the church concerning positive and direct suicide if done without gods permission this always constitutes a grave injustice towards him to destroy a thing is in effect to dispose of it as an absolute master and to act with regard to it as one who has full and independent dominion over it but god has reserved to himself dominion over life man cannot create life and he does not possess this full and absolute right over his own life consequently suicide must be reckoned as an attempt against the dominion and right of ownership of the author of life to this injustice is superadded a serious offence against the charity owed by man to himself since by selfmurder he deprives himself of the greatest good in his possession moreover this sin may be aggravated by other circumstances such as an offence against conjugal paternal or filial duty an offence against justice or charity if by taking his own life a man eludes existing obligations of justice or acts of charity which he could and should perform that suicide is unlawful is the general teaching of holy scripture which condemns the act as a most terrible crime and to arouse the horror of all against holy church denies the suicide the rites of christian burial again suicide is directly opposed to the most natural and powerful tendency of all created things and especially of intelligent man the preservation of life indeed very large numbers of physicians moralists and jurists lay it down as a general rule that suicide is always due to dementia so great is the horror which this atrocious deed inspires in every man of sane mind as a generalization this may be admitted to be true for it is impossible to think that those who have the calm and right use of their reason should deliberately destroy themselves and the conditions which are necessary to incur the full culpability of an act can only in exceptional instances be conceived of as being present in the case of a suicide sabetti inquires quaenam ad peccatum mortale p

et 53 the christian middle ages were free from the terrible tendency of suicide but with the loss of faith it reappeared and masaryk in his study der selbstmord als sociale massenerscheinung der modernen civilisation vienna 1881 considered it to be the special evil of these later days sad to relate selfdestruction has fearfully increased since the great war but it may perhaps be mitigatingly advanced that the reason of the world tottered almost to eternal delirium during the chaos and welter of blood and the balance is not recovered yet it is true that among certain nations there appears to be an indifference to human life nay a contempt of death itself which often takes the most extravagant and the most outrageous forms the goths the heathen vandals and norse savages not only approved but sought suicide and violent death it is of course only among the utterly benighted that it is possible for such abominable ideas to obtain for example there existed among a tribe of robbers in southern india customs of the utmost ferocity such practices as the following certainly prevailed during the eighteenth century but they have no doubt long since been happily suppressed if two persons had quarrelled sometimes for the most trifling reasons a man would kill himself merely in order to be revenged on his adversary he believed that p 145 his ghost would be able to return and harry the surviver  or at least that some dire retribution must fall on the head of his enemy who drove him to such extreme measures again custom required that if a man committed suicide letting it be known that it was on this account the person with whom he had had the difference that led to this abominable act must immediately follow his example lord aveburys statement it is said that in china if a rich man is condemned to death he can sometimes purchase a willing substitute at a very small expense has been traversed and professor parker would not commit himself any further than by saying it is popularly stated that substitutes can be bought for taels fifty and most certainly this statement is more than true so far as the price of human life is concerned but it is quite another question whether the gaolers and judges can always be bribed dr w t a barber who had been a missionary in china relates that he had known very large numbers of persons who committed suicide out of spite against some one else the idea being first the trouble given by minions of the law to the survivor second that the dead would gain a vantage ground by becoming a ghost and thus able to plague his enemy in the flesh it is not surprising to learn that in ancient times before the advent of christianity among such savage people as the celts and the thracians suicide was not only common but treated with the most appalling lightness and even flippancy thus athenæus speaking of the banquets of the thracians quotes from seleueus as follows and seleueus says that some of the thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging and fix a round noose to some high place exactly beneath which they place a stone which is easily turned round when any one stands upon it and then they cast lots and he who draws the lot holding a sickle in his hand stands upon the stone and puts his neck into the halter and then another person comes and raises the stone and the man who is suspended when the stone moves from under him if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle is killed and the rest laugh thinking his death good sport upon the authority of the famous stoic philosopher posidonius athenæus tells us of similar brutalities which took place among the celts he writes but posidonius in the p 146 third and also in the twentieth book of his histories says the celtæ sometimes have single combats at their entertainments for being collected in arms they go through the exercise and make feints at and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another and being irritated by this if the bystanders do not stop them they will proceed even to kill one another but in olden times he continues there was a custom that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table and the bravest man took it and if any one else laid claim to it then the two rose up to fight till one of them was slain and other men in the theatre having received some silver or gold money and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine having taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given and having distributed them among their nearest connexions have laid themselves down on doors with their faces upwards and then allowed some bystander to cut their throats with a sword and euphorion the chalcidian in his historical memorials writes as follows but among the romans it is common for five minæ to be offered to any one who chooses to take it to allow his head to be cut off with an axe so that his heirs might receive the reward and very often many have returned their names as willingly so that there has been a regular contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to death these atrocious examples serve to show us something of the evil and the corruption of which christianity cleansed the pagan world although it is to be feared that the battle is not yet won since it is a notorious and deplorable fact that at the hour of such a crisis as the great war the respect due to human life became cheapened in mens eyes with the consequence that murder and deeds of violence once more broke out in every direction showing that savage instincts were dominated indeed but in many cases not wholly eradicated it does not require a keen perception to see the direct agency of the devil here and these atrocities which bred so callous and cruel a spirit are by no means altogether unconnected with the recrudescence of necromancy and black magic which foul arts once more grew green and were almost openly pursued on every side the belief that a man has not complete dominion over his own life and that it is unlawful for him to take it is certainly a p 147 feeling naturally implanted in the human breast and it was only when nations were entirely barbarian or had became decadent and corrupt that the notion of suicide was held up as noble and even heroic whatever certain among the later greeks may have practised and taught in earlier days as we have seen the act of suicide was regarded as a dark and presumptuous deed they truly felt that there was in it something of ἀσέβεια something of that ὕβρις which so surely stirred the wrath of heaven and inevitably called down righteous vengeance indeed the evil and malice of suicide did not end with death but continued beyond the grave the umbra of a man who had slain himself was dreaded and feared so in ancient athens it was the custom to cut off the hand of a suicide and to cremate it or at least to bury it far from his body the object of such mutilation being to prevent his ghost from attacking the living similar beliefs exist among native african tribes thus the wajagga of east africa dread the spectres of suicides when a man has hanged himself a certain complicated ceremonial becomes imperative they take the rope from his neck and suspend a goat in the noose after which the animal is swiftly slain the idea seems that hereby the phantom will be in some way appeased and he will not be so likely to tempt human beings to follow his evil example the baganda of central africa have an even greater horror of the ghosts of suicides and the most elaborate precautions are invariably taken to protect themselves against these dangerous visitors the body of a man who has destroyed himself is removed as far from all human habitation as possible to waste land or to a crossroad and there is utterly consumed with fire next the wood of the house in which the horrid deed has been done is burned to ashes and scattered to the winds whilst if the man has hanged himself upon a tree this is hewn to the ground and committed to the flames trunk roots branches and all even this is hardly deemed to be sufficient curiously enough there is a lurking idea that the ghost of a suicide may survive after the cremation of the body so horrible is this crime felt to be and so irradicated the taint that this terrible deed establishes this is extremely significant since the cases in which cremation a complete purgation and destruction by fire cannot obliterate guilt and p 148 destroy the evil infection are indeed exceptional and it might be no easy task to find a parallel instance however the baganda when passing by the spot where the body of a suicide has been burned always take good care to pelt it with sticks and clods of earth to prevent the ghost from catching them although these places in particular are dangerous to the last degree there are other graves that may be haunted by phantoms which as they have no bodies are not strictly vampires but which certainly belong to the vampire family such are those remote places where persons who have been accused of black magic and who failed to satisfy the ritual ordeals have been burned to death as also those spots where persons of evil and atrocious life have been cremated or interred the maraves a tribe of south africa who also burned witches alive whenever they had occasion to pass the place of doom pelted it with stones and it is said that in some instances of spots considered particularly illomened a regular cairn or tumulus of loose stones has arisen in madagascar too certain solitary graves bear an exceedingly illrepute so that the chance traveller with averted face throws stones at them or large lumps of earth in order to prevent the ghost following in his tracks and seizing on him it must be remarked and this is very important that the sticks and stones or heavy clods of earth with which a grave is pelted are not meant merely as a symbolical insult and expression of righteous indignation but are actually missiles which will strike and hurt the being who haunts the spot of interment so since the haunter can be struck and injured by these very material objectsthe heavier they are the betterhe must himself possess a certain concrete substantiality and inasmuch as objects make an impression upon him he must exist under some kind of physical condition doubtless the exact idea is not very clearly defined in the minds of those who are so careful to pelt the grave yet if stones will not merely ward off an attack from the haunter but when in the course of time they become piled up into a small cairn they serve to keep the deceased in his place that is to say in the grave there must be some sort of material entity which can be so materially frustrated and obstructed here then we have the essential and complete vampire it is recorded by a traveller about the middle of the last p 149 century that when he was journeying in company with two mussulmans from sidon to tyre as he drew near the latter city he noticed a great pile of stones by the wayside whereupon his companions began to pick up all the loose pebbles that came to hand and discharged them violently at the heap at the same time uttering the most fearful imprecations when they had passed and were at some little distance they explained that a notorious brigand whose hands were stained with the hideous cruelties and innocent blood had been slain there and buried on the spot half a century before the stones they threw and their curses were directed against this villain it might be thought in this case that the missiles were a mark of loathing and contempt but it seems far more probable that they were intended to serve a very utilitarian purpose that is actually to keep off the wretch who would still be haunting the pit into which his body had been cast fifty years since it even appears that in many parts of syria when brigands are killed by the highway or vagrom murderers are dispatched in the open country side beyond the walls of a city the body is left to rot unburied where it lies and after a while it is merely covered over with a heap of stones moreover everyone who passes by is bound to quoit a stone or stick to add to the pile under the penalty of incurring some dreadful misfortune it is supposed that heaven will horribly curse the person who fails to throw his flinty tribute as he goes it is not only among rude african tribes and in the east that the graves of persons who have led cruel and antisocial lives particularly the spots where suicides have been buried are thus places of execration and fear but in pomerania and in west prussia not to instance many other districts the spots where persons who have wrought their own destruction happen to be interred are regarded as unlucky in the highest degree and there is no more malevolent and harmful spectre than the suicides ghost a man who has destroyed himself must not defile gods acre in no wise may he be buried in the churchyard but at the place where the desperate deed was done and everybody who passes by will cast a stone on the spot unless he wishes the ghost of the suicide to plague him nightly and to give him no rest until he is driven to the same dreadful fate it is said that as in africa piles of sticks p 150 and stones accumulate to a great size so similar cairns rise upon these haunted spots in the more remote districts along the cold shores washed by the baltic sea it is not surprising to find that in a country such as russia which through the ages has so often tottered to madness and of late years fallen into stark lunacy during the seventeenth century an epidemic of suicide raged it persisted indeed at spasmodic intervals throughout the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries but it was somewhat earlier than this that the troubles of that luckless nation blazed out in furious frenzy as when the year 1000 approached a fearful apocalyptic mania inflamed many parts of europe and men imagining that the world was about to come to an end that almost any hour any moment the angels clarion would blare heaven and earth shrivel like some parching scroll and the judge be set on his awful throne in their hundreds deserted cities and homes to wander abroad preaching fevered repentance and the most extravagent forms of penance or else in frantic despair abandoned themselves to debauchery and violence so in russia some mad visionary who proclaimed that the crack of doom was appointed for the year 1666 set the whole country aflame with terror in many parts men ceased to labour in the fields relinquished their businesses and all social intercourse barricaded themselves in their houses behind closed windows and fastbarred doors awaiting the end with the gloomiest forebodings as might have been expected great numbers completely lost their senses and scores of dangerous lunatics not only infested the highroad but even invaded villages and towns preaching that the only way to escape the wrath to come was to prevent the final day by selfdestruction they were moreover very willing and eager to help those who shrank from so severe a test and before long red murder was rife in every direction their services however were not required as frequently as might have been supposed for the delirium spread with such alarming rapidity that not merely households but whole communities eagerly devoted themselves to death if in some paroxysm of wild hysteria a man had declared his intention of becoming a martyr for so these poor wretches were deemed the pious duty devolved upon his friends and relations of seeing that he scrupulously fulfilled his vow should he p 151 wish to change his mind or in any way seek to escape his fate he was pursued and saved in spite of himself by being put to death in the most atrocious torments a veritable reign of terror ensued and northern russia seemed wellnigh depopulated it were superfluous to enter into the horrible details but it may suffice to say that at first starvation was the usual method by which these maniacs committed suicide in the forest of vetlouga one fanatic at huge expense actually built a tower without doors and windows into the body of which persons were lowered through a trap in the roof but this was too long a process it gave space for reflection and with the pangs of hunger reason resumed her sway those within yelled to be released but all in vain to shouts and clamour succeeded groans and fainter lamentations until as the days passed all was still another remedy was found and presently the method which was preferred and which was officially prescribed as safer and more pleasing to god was immolation by fire accordingly the missionaries of this horrible impiety proclaimed safety through the flame as the prophet elias had ascended to heaven in a blazing chariot so the deluded wretches were taught they would ascend to a glorious and delightful eternity from the midst of the conflagration hundreds and even thousands perished in huge holocausts whole areas were strictly enclosed the candidates took their places therein and the compound having been previously drenched with pitch bitumen and inflammable oils torches were applied at many points if any overcome by agony escaped with scorched and blackened limbs they were caught and hurled back into the heart of the pyre these immolations generally took place during the dark winter season and from midnight until the faint streaks of dawn the red glow of these horrid furnaces could be seen in every direction for hundreds of verstas the land became a veritable tophet as the morning broke hordes of wolves attracted by the stench of roasting flesh assembled to pull trunks and limbs from the embers a dark cloud of suffocating smoke greasy with human fat that fouled both ground and houses hung low in the sky and ere many days were past the plague was stalking abroad with fatal voracity it was not until the most vigorous measures had been taken that these terrible practices could be checked and it seems that the p 152 venom of the madness persisted long and late for as recently as 1860 fifteen persons in the district of olonetz committed suicide by fire whilst during the winter of 18961897 twentyfour religious fanatics buried themselves alive in a pit near tiraspol the monk falaley constantly preached that death was mans only means of salvation and that he must have done with this life of sin one night under his influence eightyfour persons congregated near the river perevozinka and began to pray many of them were already halfcrazed through excessive fasting and they almost covered themselves with brambles and brushwood to which fire was to be set at a given signal a woman taking alarm at the thought of so horrible a death escaped and informed the authorities when the police arrived the fanatics shrieked that antichrist was approaching and setting fire to the pile most perished in the flames a few who were rescued received sentences of imprisonment and deportation but a fanatic called souchkoff managed to escape and continued to preach the gospel of death maddened by his doctrine in one locality alone sixty families resolved to commit suicide at a certain moment and a peasant named petroff entering a neighbours house cut down his wife and children with a hatchet in a barn hard by a dozen men with their wives had assembled and amid hymns of triumph they laid their heads upon an improvised block to be hacked off by petroff in another hut a woman and three children were dispatched at their own earnest request at length when he was weary petroff himself kneeled down and was slain by souchkoff between 1860 and 1870 a maniac named chadkin proclaimed that antichrist was here and all most follow him to the forests and there die of hunger a large number assembled and his most devoted followers saw to it that nobody could escape after a few days the sufferings of the crowds were fearful and the place rang with their screams and groans nevertheless chadkin and his apostles did not waver when some poor creature frantic with agony managed to break away and informed the police the devotees at once began to kill all who had gathered together and by the time the authorities had arrived in the utmost haste there were found but three survivors buddhist monks in china are often recorded to have p 153 sought their nirvana through an act of self immolation by fire and it is said that every year among the lamaresais of tientai in the province of taichow some halfadozen bonzes thus devote themselves to death these unfortunate persons believe that their voluntary destruction crowns the monastery with honours and blessing they are aware that they will be worshipped after their suicide and they suppose that they will become the divinities of the district and possess the power to protect the whole neighbourhood to grant fair weather and lucky seasons a bounteous harvest and all prosperity such public incinerations are conducted with great ceremony and take place upon a major festival which is bound to attract crowds of pilgrims and reverent suppliants to the spot it is said that among the eskimo of bering strait a sorcerer has been known to burn himself alive fully believing that thus he will return to life as a shaman with much greater powers and a far fuller knowledge of magic than he had hitherto enjoyed it may be remembered that even such low motives as vanity and a craving for mere notoriety have proved an incentive sufficiently powerful to induce men to seek a dramatic if painful death by fire thus the charlatan peregrinus after a career of the most braggart ostentation courted undying fame by selfimmolation upon a pyre at the olympic festival which extraordinary performance attracted throngs not only of sensible persons who despised and mocked him but of encomiasts and apologists who regarded him as at the least a hero if not something nearly approaching to deity it can hardly be argued that higher motives inspired empedocles if the account preserved by diogenes laertius to which horace makes reference be true namely that hoping by a sudden disappearance he might be accounted a god the philosopher flung himself into the crater of mount aetna but that the suicide was revealed owing to the fact that the volcano almost immediately after threw up one of his sandals and thus betrayed the manner of his death josephus states that the jews used not to bury the bodies of those who had destroyed themselves until after sunset in scotland it is still thought that the body of a suicide will not fall to dust until the time when he should have died in the order of nature and it is very generally held that a such p 154 a one must be buried with the grave facing north and south this belief also existed in england and there are graves facing north and south to be seen at cowden kent and bergholt suffolk which are locally said to be those of persons who have destroyed themselves for it is almost universally declared that christian burial should be with the head in west looking eastward as is wellknown in england until the time of george iv it was the general practice to bury suicides at the crossroads where a stake was driven through the body in the year 1823 it was enacted that the body of a suicide should be buried privately between the hours of nine oclock and twelve at night with no religious ceremony in 1882 this law was altered and the body may now be committed to the earth at any time and with such rites or prayers those in charge of the funeral think fit or may be able to procure in certain country places it is still supposed that the spirit of the last person buried in a graveyard has to keep watch lest any suicide should be interred there one explanation of the reason why persons who had taken their own lives should be buried at the crossroads was that the ghosts of murdered persons were supposed to walk until the bodies had been recovered and committed to the churchyard with christian rites and since this was impossible in the case of suicides a stake was driven through them when deposited at the crossroads in order to keep the ghost from wandering abroad it is certain that the idea here is the same as that of driving a stake through the vampire for sometimes this precaution was taken in the case of persons who might perchance become vampires an operation performed not as an indignity but as a preventitive burchard of worms tells us cum aliquis femina parere debit et non potest in ipso dolore si mortem obierit in ipso sepulchro matrem cum infante palo in terram transfigunt and again fecisti quod quaedam mulieres instinctu diaboli facere solent cum aliquis infans sine baptismo mortuus fuerit tollunt cadauer paruuli et ponunt in aliquo secreto loco et palo corpusculum transfigunt dicentes si sic non fecissent quod infantulus surgeret et multos laedere posset the reason for the selected spot of the suicides grave being a crossroad is further explained by the belief that when the ghost or the body issues from the grave and finds that there p 155 are four paths stretching in as many directions he will be puzzled to know which way to take and will stand debating until dawn compels him to return to the earth but woe betide the unhappy being who happens to pass by when he is lingering there perplexed and confused accordingly after sunset every sensible person will avoid all crossroads since there are no localities more certainly and more fearfully haunted and disturbed it will readily be remembered that the romans were far more precise than we used to be in their definition of crossroads and employed no less than three terms biuium when the road branched into two triuium when the road forked into three and quadriuium when the intersection of the ways gave four arms the prophet ezechiel tells us that esarhaddon took his stand in biuio when he wished to divine stetit enim rex babylonis in biuio in capite duarum uiarum diuinationem quaerens commiscens sagittas interrogauit idola exta consuluit xxi 21 for the king of babylon stood in the highway at the head of two ways seeking divination shuffling arrows he enquired of the idols and consulted entrails triuia is the common name given to diana when as hecate

saturnalia i ix notes dianae uero ut triuiae uiarum omnium iidem tribuunt potestatem in wales it was said that witches slept by day under any boulder that might be at a crossroad and when dusk had fallen they crept forth to steal little children and feast upon their flesh the gallows was often erected at the crossroads and here the criminal hung in chains and nourished by his rotting flesh the mandrake grew many are the superstitions which cluster around the mandrake or mandragorathe semihuman as columella de re rustica x 19 calls it it was the plant of fertility the plant of magical virtue and occult power in germany it bears the name of the little gallows man and it was believed that when a murderer or p 156 thief was hanged and his semen or urine fell to the ground there grew up the mandrake in england the same superstition prevailed and in his pasquil a character of an ugly woman or a hue and cry after beauty 1678 the duke of buckingham wrote imprimis as to her descent some heralds derive her pedigree from that of the scotch barnacles and say that she dropt from some teeming gallows or sprung up like mandrakes from the s of some gibbitid raggamuffian no one must dare uproot the mandrake for it moans and shrieks so fearfully that the digger will die with the yells ringing in his ears a dog is taken and round his tail is tied a string one end of which is attached to

fall dead at the horrid scream it gives but there has been secured a talisman nay more a familiar even in the mythology of ceylon the crossroads play an ominous part thus in the yakkun nattanawa which is defined by its translator john callaway as a cingalese poem descriptive of the ceylon system of demonology it is said of the black shedevil thou female devil who acceptest the offerings at the place where three ways meet thou causest the people to be sick by looking upon them at the place where four ways join together the devil mahasohon watches to drink the blood of the elephant in the place where the two and three roads meet together mahasohon is the devil of the tombs therefore go not in the roads by night if you do so you must not expect to escape with your life another devil oddy stands where three ways meet watching and hot for mischief again the devil of the victim watches and looks upon the people and causes them to be sick at the place where three roads meet and where four ways meet ralstan says that it is a common russian belief that at crossroads or in the neighbourhood of cemeteries an animated corpse often lurks watching for some unwary traveller whom it may be able to strangle and devour eagerly quaffing the warm blood from his veins in cornwall today crossroads are most carefully avoided after nightfall but this may be because it is commonly accepted that at the crossroads p 157 witches from all the world over assemble for their sabbat it seems more likely that these particular spots are avoided because of the vampires for henry boguet tells us les sorciers tiennet leurs sabbats indifferemet en tons lieux bernhard ragner says that if you go to a crossroad between eleven oclock and midnight on christmas eve and listen you will hear what most concerns you for the coming year it may be pointed out that this is the one night throughout the year when strange wonders happen it is then that the thorn that sprang at glastonbury from the sacred crown which the holy old man s joseph of arimathea brought with him from palestine when avalon was still an island bourgeons into fragrant blossoms the cornish miners seem to hear the sound of singing choirs that arise from submerged churches by the shore and others said that bells beneath the ground where villages had been upon that eve yearly ring a glad peal at midnight the oxen the cattle and all the beasts kneel and adore as they adored in the stablecave at bethlehem no evil thing hath power and as the officer in hamlet tells us some say that ever gainst that season comes wherein our saviours birth is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit can walk abroad the nights are wholesome then no planets strike no fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm so hallowd and so gracious is the time in certain districts of east prussia on christmas eve candles are kept burning all night in the houses and no window is shuttered it is supposed that the spirits of the dead will return in friendlywise and the opportunity is given to them to warm themselves so that on future occasions when they haunt the villages with more malicious intent they may remember those who are kind to them christmas after christmas and spare those houses from molestation and injury not only are those who die excommunicate that is to say solemnly and officially cursed by the church liable to become vampires but more those who die under any kind of such ban especially if it be the malison of a parent or if it be a man who has perjured himself in a grave matter and called down upon his own head damnation and all manner of evil should p 158 what he asseverate be untrue the belief in the fearful power of a curse especially the curse of a father or a mother which whether rightfully or wrongfully adjured works out its vengeance through the whole stock of kith and kin involving in misfortunes and destruction innocent and guilty alike finds supreme illustration in the masterpieces of greek tragedy it is the mighty theme of the trilogy of the oresteia for from the very outset of the agamemnon there is a brooding and oppressive sense of multitudinous crimes of sins done long years ago which have swelled and accumulated their guilt like some black cloud of transgressions about to burst over the doomed race in a welter of tragedy and blood the evil wrought by thyestes the crimes of his grandsire tantalus the atrocious banquet of atreus have yet to be expiated in misery in anguish and affliction when the weird trojan woman approaches the threshold she scents the carnage of the shambles and horrors manifold and as the pang of inspiration thrills her she shrieks aloud the furies are in this house bloodsurfeited but not assuaged they hold perpetual revel here it is the crime of atreus and of thyestes which they hunt and woe will follow woe τὴν γὰρ στέγην τήνδ οὔποτ ἐκλείπει χορος σύμφθογγος οὐκ εὔφωνοςσυπ οὐ γὰρ εῦ λέγει καὶ μὴν πεπωκώς γ ὡς

whose family was as equally famous among the greeks as the stock of atreus for its overwhelming disasters the bitter fruit of an undying curse which destroyed the whole race laius the son of labdacus had wrought a mighty evil lusting after the beauty of chrysippus the son of pelops with violence he raped the lad who belonged to another and thus had sinned the sin of ὕβρις since he both betrayed anothers love and used brute force in doing so for this crime his whole progeny was involved in destruction he married jocasta the sister of creon of thebes and the oracle warned him that his son should kill him when a boy was born to the royal pair they cruelly exposed their child a helpless infant to the p 159 wild beasts on mount cithaeron but the will of heaven is not frustrated by the impotence of man many years after as king laius is riding privately in his chariot attended by only five servants they meet a young man upon the road the king bids him make way commanding him in rough and insolent terms a quarrel arises the stranger a stalwart warrior strikes down the master and certain of the servants but one escapes and fled away for his life presently oedipus solves the riddle of the monstrous sphinx when the thebans in gratitude since their old monarch has been slain by robbers on the highway elect him to rule over them giving him the lady jocasta to wife he governs the state in great prosperity and four children are born to him two sons polyneices and eteocles two daughters antigone and ismene it is the calm before the storm a fearful plague afflicts the city and when the divine phoebus apollo is consulted he answers that the murderer of laius must be driven from the land the old prophet teiresias the mystic whose converse is in heaven but who yet in his stern pride still retains much of humanity is asked to rede the enigma he answers with deep sighs and groans seeking to be led home again until goaded by the impatience and hot temper of the king he flashes forth the truth but it is not immediately recognized and oedipus begins formally to inquire into the circumstances of the death of his predecessor detail is heaped upon detail and at last the horrible revelation forces itself upon his soul mad with terror jocasta hangs herself within her bedchamber and oedipus tearing from her dress the buckles and clasps of gold strikes out his eyes that are unworthy to look upon the golden light of day one moment a king the next a beggar red with parricide polluted with the fires of incest accursed of god and man in the bitterness of utter dereliction he must go forth desolate and alone he dare not even bid farewell to his sons and daughters for they are the children of doom seed of that admixture too fearful to be named in the next play the oedipus coloneus we find him many years afterwards a mysterious figure set apart by heaven in awful loneliness he is waiting in a place of peculiar sanctity the reverent groves of the semnai theai the holy goddesses of divine retribution waiting for his silent passage to the shadowy world and even here the evil ambitions of his sons would p 160 fain disturb him at the end but he is far removed from the strife and passion of this world and when young polyneices fair false and fickle endeavours to enlist his fathers sympathies the lad receives the awful answer dry were your eyes hard as stone your heart dumb your lips when i went forth from thebes friendless and alone here then is your reward before the walls of thebes you shall perish pierced by your brothers hand and there your brother shall die slain by you this terrible imprecation is only too terribly fulfilled and defying the laws of king creon who would have the cursepolluted ghosts of the brothers seek for rest in vain even in hades antigone meets her doom nor does creon the respectable creon weak and spiteful impotent yet a tyrant escape scathless his malice is sharply punished owing to his own folly and cruelty he loses both wife and son for he has forgotten that great truth which s thomas enunciated that reason is the first principle of all human works and the secular power is subject to the spiritual even as the body is subject to the soul so owing to his impiety he is left without child to carry on his name bereaved of all broken and collapsed piteously confessing himselfμάταιον ἄνδραfeckless and foolish old man it has seemed worth while thus very briefly and inadequately to review these two great themes of greek tragedy since in both instances they set forth in detail the terrible and relentless working of a curse which it may be said has something of that divine vengeance that visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation and so something of this old greek doctrine was very true for who can foresee the end of the working of a curse even today there are places and there are properties in england which owing to deeds of blood and violence in their acquisition entail some dire misfortune upon all who seek to enjoy and possess them such a place is the ruined abbey of glastonbury and of many another housetintern newstead cowdray waverley barlings croxton durefordthe tale is true de male quaesita non gaudet tertius haeres says the old adage and it is well known that lands wrested from the church will not descend in due course owing to a failure of heirs such a case has come under my own observation and aubrey in his miscellanies cites hinton charterhouse p 161 on mendip and butleigh near glastonbury as never having passed to the third generation so did cromwells generals and adherents transmit a troubled inheritance to their descendants fairfax house putney had its haunted chamber which was never used it must be remembered that a solemn curse is not merely an expletive or an imprecatory exclamation perhaps quite meaningless but it is far more than this it is significant and operative the malediction is conceived as having a certain efficacious power and it may be noted that this force if rightly launched does not seem to exhaust itself no more terrible fate could be imagined than for a man to become a vampire and this was the inevitable consequence if he were not cleared of a merited malison the old proverb says curses are like young chicken and still come home to roost this adage is terribly exemplified in the vampire who is supposed when he returns from his grave first to attack those who on earth have been his nearest and dearest of all curses the parental malediction is most dreaded and curiously enough in macedonia mr abbott tells us that a godfather is regarded with even greater respect than the actual parents and his malediction is dreaded even more than that of a bishop at the present day in greece many of the usual imprecations definitely refer to the fact that the person so cursed will become a vampire after death such imprecations as the following are in common use may the earth not receive him νὰ μήν τον δεχτῃ ἡ γῆς may the ground not consume him νὰ μήν τον φάλῃ τὸ χῶμα may the earth not digest thee ἡ γῆ νὰ μή δε χυνέψῃ may the black earth spew thee up ἡ μαύρη γῆ νά σ ἀναξεράσῃ mayest thou remain incorrupt να μείνῃς ἄλωμτος may the earth not loose thee which is to say may the body not decompose νὰ μή σε λυώσῃ ἡ γἠ may the ground reject thee νά σε βλάλῃ τὸ χῶμα mayest thou a become in the grave like rigid wood κουτοῦκι νὰ βλῃς may the ground reject him wholly τὸ χῶμα ξεράς τόνε which last phrase is the most terrible of all since it is nothing other than an unspeakably impious parody of the prayer which is uttered by the mourners at every greek funeral ὁθεὸς χωρές τόνε may god forgive him p 162 since even the curse uttered by a man in moments of anger and impatience may have such terrible effects in greece it is necessary that there should be some expedient which may dissipate and dispel the forces to which these words have given an impetus capable of producing the most serious and horrible results accordingly at a greek deathbed there is carried out a certain ritual to attain this end a vessel of water is brought to the bedside and he throws into it a handful of salt and when this is dissolved the sick man sprinkles with the lymph all those who are present saying as this salt dissolves so may my curses dissolve ὡς λυώνει τἀλάτι νὰ λυὡσουν ᾑ κατάραισ μου this ceremony absolves all persons whom he may have cursed in his lifetime from the evil of a ban which after death he would no longer be able to revoke the relations and friends then solemnly forgive the dying man for ought that he may have done against them and all present declare that they bear no grudge nor anger in their hearts it is said that if the passage be a difficult one it is supposed that somebody whom the sick man has injured has not forgiven him if it can be guessed who this may be he is if possible brought to the bedside to declare his forgiveness of any injury he may have suffered if however he be dead a portion of the cerements must be sought and burned to ashes in the bedchamber of the dying person who is fumigated with the smoke these elaborate precautions and the extraordinary care which is taken for it must often be a matter of very great difficulty either to secure the attendance of the living individual or to get hold of a portion of the necessary shroud serve to show what immense importance the modern greek attaches to the absolution from a curse and what horror the thought of a vampire inspires it is obvious that those who die unbaptized or apostate will be liable to become vampires after death and throughout the south of europe there still persist large numbers of ceremonies and superstitions connected with a christening whose object it is to secure the child a long happy and healthy life in england as in many other countries it is thought lucky to be born on one of the great church festivals especially if it be a sunday in certain districts of yorkshire even today it is commonly said that sunday children are secure from p 163 the malice of evil spirits again a child born on a saturday although he may have to work hard for his living is considered to enjoy occult powers to have the faculty of second sight to be able to see ghosts and phantoms and indeed to be so attuned to the supernatural that he can never be harmed even by the vampire it is very probable that as saturday is the seventh day of the week those born upon this day are considered as akin to a seventh son who was so popularly believed to possess extraordinary powers of healing and the like the old english rhyme is well known and perhaps the following is one of the most usual forms mondays child is fair of face tuesdays child is full of grace wednesdays child is sour and grum thursdays child has welcome home fridays child is free in giving saturdays child works hard for his living and the child that is born on christmas day is great and good and fair and gay although as we have said in england it is considered am omen of a happy life to be born upon some festival the exact opposite is the case in slav countries in greece particularly nothing could be more disastrous and of all seasons christmas day is the most unlucky in many districts it is accounted a terrible thing for any child to be born at any time between christmas and the epiphany such babies are called ἑορτοπιάσματα or feastblasted and after death they will assuredly become vampires even during life such a child is a callicantzaros the callicantzaros is one of the most extraordinary and most horrible of all the creatures of popular superstition leone allacci says that they only appear and have power during the week from christmas to new years day but other authorities extend this time until twelfth night during the rest of the year it is vaguely supposed that they sojourn in some mysterious hades or underworld local traditions differ as to whether they are actually demons or whether they are human allacci who certainly inclines to the latter view says that children born in the octave of christmas are liable to be seized with a terrible mania that they rush to and fro with the most amazing speed that their nails grow to a p 164 terrible length like the talons of a bird of prey whilst their hands become as crooked claws if they meet any person on the highway they seize him and put the question tow or lead if he answer tow he may escape unharmed but if he be inadvertent enough to reply lead they grip him with terrible force mangle him with their talons and often tear him to pieces devouring him wholemeal during the seventeenth century this belief so strongly prevailed that the most cruel precautions were taken in the case of children who might be suspected to be liable to become callicantzari since the soles of their feet were exposed to a fire until the nails were singed and so their claws clipped and even today in parts of greece these practices prevail in a highly modified form for among the ægean islanders it is said that the small callicantzari are particularly prone to attack and devour their own brothers and sisters which is another strong link with the tradition of the vampire who as we have noted before seeks the destruction of his own kin it is difficult to convey any idea of the popular notions concerning the appearance of a callicantzaros as almost every local account differs from others in almost every particular for the most part they are considered to be very gaunt and of enormous strength on the other hand there are some who are dwarfed and stunted the larger variety generally appear as ineffably hideous monsters with black distorted faces eyes glaring red like fire huge ears such as those of a donkey great gaping mouths furnished with a slobbering scarlet tongue and sharp gleaming teeth from which streams their fetid breath in horrid gusts again the pigmy callicantzaros may appear in the shape of a child but in this case it is usually deformed in some grotesque and painful manner on the other hand they are sometimes harmless hobgoblins full of mischief maybe but objects of laughter rather than fear though they may play many a naughty and tiresome trick not unlike the kobold and the leprechaun a hundred tales are told of their pranks but it is the more gruesome and the fiercer monsters with whom we are mainly concerned since it is from their ranks that the vampire is recruited for most of them become vampires after death a fact which seems to point to their human origin and not infrequently they are supposed to indulge their vampirish p 165 fancies during life it will be noticed that in the various accounts of the callicantzari there exist many contradictions and we must bear in mind that such diversities are often due to the original conception of these creatures whether they are regarded as demons or monsters who are suffered to plague the countryside for a certain number of days during the christmas season or whether they are regarded as human beings afflicted with a terrible curse the victims of a most horrible possession doomed never to rest not even in the grave near akin to the latter conception is the werewolf who may be regarded as a man or woman who either of his or her own will through black magic is able to change into the form of a wolf or who in classical times was believed to be so changed owing to the vengeance of the gods and in later days was believed to be so changed owing to the enchantment of a witch or some manner of diabolic possession moreover a werewolf may be a person who without any actual metamorphosis is obsessed with all the savage passions and ferocity of a wolf so that he will attack human beings in the same way as the actual wild animal it may be asked is it possible that a person should be so transformed henry kramer and james sprenger the learned authors of the supremely authoritative malleus maleficarum in discussing the question distinctly answer no it is not possible they allow that by horrid charms and spells a certain subjective delusion or glamour may be caused so that by the evil art of a sorcerer a man may appear to himself and to all others who gaze upon him to be a wolf or indeed another kind of animal but there cannot be any actual physical change of a man into an animal this glamour or ocular illusion is sometimes known as sightshifting a convenient correlative to the accepted term shapeshifting which is conceived of as an objective fact moreover in his de ciuitate dei xviii 18 s augustine says nor can the devils create anything whatever shows of theirs produce these doubts but only cast a changed shape over that which god has made altering only in show nor do i think the devil can form any soul or body into bestial or brutal members and essences but they have an unspeakable way of transporting mans phantasy in a bodily shape unto other senses this though it be not corporal yet seems to carry itself in corporal p 166 forms through all these things while the bodies of the men thus affected lie in another place being alive but yet in an ecstasy far more deep than any sleep now this phantasy may appear unto other senses in a bodily shape and a man may seem to himself to be such an one as he often thinks himself to be in his dream and to bear burdens which if they be true burdens indeed the devils bear them to delude mens eyes with the appearance of true burdens and false shapes we must bear in mind that these explanations come from the highest authority one of the greatest doctors of the church and will i think very fairly cover most of the cases of the werewolf in early days it was recognized that a werewolf might be a person who was afflicted with a horrible mania and marcellus sidetes who lived in the reigns of hadrian and antoninus pius circa ad 117161 wrote περὶ λυκανθρώπου a long medical poem in greek hexameter verse consisting of fortytwo books of which only a couple of fragments remain he says that lycanthropy is a disease a kind of insanity or mania when the patient was afflicted with hideous appetites the ferocity and other qualities of a wolf he further tells us that men are attacked with this madness chiefly in the beginning of the year and become most furious in february retiring for the night to lone cemeteries and living precisely in the manner of ravening wolves under lycanthropia burton notes as follows lycanthropia which avicenna calls cucubuth others lupinam insaniam or wolfmadness when men run howling about graves and fields in the night and will not be persuaded but that they are wolves or some such beasts aetius lib 6 cap 11 and paulus lib 3 cap 16 call it a kind of melancholy but i should rather refer it to madness as most do some make a doubt of it whether there be any such disease donat ab altomari cap 9 art med saith that he saw two of them in his time wierus de praestig daemonum 1 3 cap 21 tells a story of such a one at padua 1541 that would not believe to the contrary but that he was a wolf he hath another instance of a spaniard who thought himself a bear forrestus obseruat lib 10 de morbis cerebri cap 15 confirms as much by many examples one amongst the rest of which he was an eyewitness at alcmaer in holland a poor p 167 husbandman that still hunted about graves and kept in churchyards of a pale black ugly and fearful look    this malady saith avicenna troubleth men most in february and is nowadays frequent in bohemia and hungary according to heurnius cap de man schernitzius will have it common in livonia they lie hid most part all day and go abroad in the night barking howling at graves and deserts they have usually hollow eyes scabbed legs and thighs very dry and pale ulcerata crura sitis ipsis adest immodica pallidi lingua sicca saith altomarus cap 9 art hydrophobia he gives a reason there of all the symptoms and sets down a brief cure of them it is remarkable that most of these features are found in the vampire especially the unquenchable thirst sitis immodica which is emphasized by the famous physician antonio donato altomari who was one of the most learned authorities of his day it is also remarkable that the malady is reported as being very prevalent in bohemia hungary and livonia countries in which the vampire is most frequently found there is in fact a very close connexion between the werewolf and the vampire and the lycanthropist is liable to become a vampire when he dies in parts of greece particularly in elis it is said that even those who eat the flesh of a sheep that has been killed by a wolf are apt to become vampires after their death and this serves to show how powerful the pollution of the werewolf was supposed to be in norse saga ingiald the son of king aunund was timid whilst a boy but after eating the heart of a wolf he gained strength and courage and became the boldest of heroes it might be thought that so far from inspiring a person with a thirst for blood the flesh of a sheep would homœopathically infuse qualities of gentleness and indeed the abipones of paraguay were most careful to avoid mutton lest it should make them slack and fearful in the fight but in this instance it will be seen that the characteristics of a sheep have been absorbed so to speak and infected by the ferocity of the wolf curiously enough in uganda the baganda greatly fear the ghosts of sheep which they believe would return and kill a man if they saw him give them the fatal blow hence when a sheep is to be killed one man occupies its attention in some way and another whose presence the animal must not suspect swiftly slaughters it before p 168 a glimpse of him can be caught in this way the sheep is tricked because the ghost does not know whom to haunt and punish for its death moreover sheep give health and protection to cattle and a ram is almost invariably sent into the pastures with a herd of cows should a sheep die in a house nobody must dare openly to mention the fact which may only be alluded to in the most covert and circumlocutionary phrase for were anyone to say the sheep is dead its ghost sorely angered would assuredly afflict the unlucky speaker with some disease and possibly even kill him outright it is worth noting that among the ancient greeks it was thought that any garment made from the fleece of a sheep which had been worried or torn by a wolf would have a bad effect upon the wearer and set up some roseola and an intense irritation of the skin it is certainly curious to note the whole mass of tradition which as it would seem the wide world over is connected with the sheep and in particular when this animal has been attacked or slain by a wolf even as some kind of vampirish infection was held to proceed from the wolf the vampire himself will even more strongly convey this taint and therefore unless the most drastic and immediate remedies are applied a person who is attacked by a vampire and whose blood has been sucked will become a vampire in turn imbued with a craving to pass on the horrible pollution this is perhaps and with good reason the most dreaded quality of the vampire and examples thereof occur again and again in legend and history it is far more curious that it should be thought that those over whose dead bodies a cat or any other animal has passed should become vampires this belief widely exists amongst slavonic peoples and is to be found in some parts of greece it also prevails in china where a cat is never allowed to enter a room with a corpse for the body still contains the kuei the lower or inferior soul of yin original and by leaping over it the cat will impart something of its original savage or tigerish nature and the dead man may become a vampire it should be explained that it is a common belief among the chinese that there are two souls the higher soul which after death seeks the divine life the heavenly source of its being and the lower soul which is gross returning to the p 169 earth and dwelling in the grave until the complete dissolution of the corpse it is believed among slavonic nations as it was firmly believed throughout england and in many districts of france that witches turn themselves into cats and among the oraons or uraons a primitive hill tribe of bengal we have a vampire cat who is a chordewa a witch who is able to change her soul into a black cat and who then visits and frequents the houses where there are sick and dying people such a cat has a peculiar way of mewing quite differently from the noise of other cats and is easily recognized it steals quietly into a house almost like a shadow leaps lightly on the bed eats of the food that has been prepared for the sick man and gently licks his lips when it is able to accomplish this latter the invalid has no chance of recovering in which connexion we must remember as has been remarked before that the soul is supposed to take its departure from the mouth of a dying person even if this cat be seen it is extraordinarily difficult to catch it since it has a supernatural activity and will fight and scratch with the malice of a demon however they say that persons have sometimes succeeded and then the woman out of whom the cat her soul has come remains insensible in a state of coma as deep as death until the cat reenters her body any wound inflicted upon the cat is produced upon her for example if they cut it or break a leg or destroy its sight the woman will simultaneously suffer the same mutilation so great a horror had the oraons of these witches that formerly they used to burn any person that was suspected to be a chordewa it is a circumstance of very frequent occurrence in the witch trials of all countries that a witch who has appeared in the likeness of a cat a hare or any other animal and has met with an accident or been mutilated under that form is found to be marked with the same wound or to be suffering from the same harm in her human shape when this is resumed it is not difficult then to see why if some animal of illomenand the cat seems to be particularly unfortunateleaps over a corpse the dead person should be considered in danger of becoming a vampire in greece particularly in macedonia the most pious care is taken to prevent any such calamity the body is watched all night long by relatives and friends p 170 and this is deemed a work of true charity by which they acquire great merit it brings a blessing upon their own souls ψυκικό if in spite of all their care some cat does jump across the body the dead man must be pierced through with two long sackneedles σακκορράφαισ in order to secure his rest and to guard against his return it is well to scatter mustard seed on the roof and on the threshold and the wise man will barricade his door with brambles and thorns should the vampire return he cannot fail to occupy himself with counting the seeds and it will be dawn when he must return to his grave long before he completes the tale should he endeavour to pass through the bushes he will inevitably be caught and held fast by the briars ralston tells us that the serbs and the bulgarians keep this vigil even more carefully than the greeks in some places the jumping of a boy over the corpse is considered as fatal as that of a cat the flight of a bird above the body may also be attended by the same terrible results and so mayin the ukrainethe mere breath of the wind from the steppe what is extremely curious is that this tradition still lingers in the north of england and if a cat or dog pass over a corpse the animal must be killed at once the reason for this has been entirely forgotten but the survival is very remarkable as showing that once there existed a dread of vampires in england which today is entirely forgotten thomas pennant says that in scotland no dog or cat must be allowed to leap over the corpse or enter the room it is reckoned so ominous their doing so that the poor animal is killed without mercy it is even still the custom that all animals shall be shut up till the funeral procession has left it is believed that a cat will not remain in the house with an unburied corpse and rooks we know will abandon the place till after the funeral if the rookery be near the mansion the explanation given by john jamieson that if a cat has leapt over a corpse the first person on to whose lap he may afterwards jump or who may take him up in his arms is stricken with blindness would seem to be a later invention a reason made up to explain the illomen when the vampire tradition had disappeared and so the real reason had been entirely forgotten having investigated the various reasons why any person p 171 should become a vampire and discussed the fatal accident which may bring about this terrible doom various points present themselves which invite some inquiry although the belief varies in different parts of the world and it is generally understood that vampires only operate by night as king david says non timebis a timore nocturno thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night yet it is also supposed that under certain conditions vampires may wander abroad during the day and that the vampire truly is daemonium meridianum the noonday devil therefore we may ask by what signs if any is a vampire to be recognized again how does a vampire leave his grave for we must remember that the vampire is tangible and can make his presence felt in a very unmistakable and terrible manner this difficulty has been very clearly stated by dom calmet who writes as follows how can a corpse which is covered with four or five feet of earth which has no room even to move or to stretch a limb which is wrapped in linen cerements enclosed in a coffin of wood how can it i say seek the upper air and return to the world walking upon the earth so as to cause those extraordinary effects which are attributed to it and after all that how can it go back again into the grave when it will be found fresh incorrupt full of blood exactly like a living body can it be maintained that these corpses pass through the earth without disturbing it just as water and the damps which penetrate the soil or which exhale therefrom without perceptibly dividing or cleaving the ground it were indeed to be wished that in the histories of the return of vampires which have been related a certain amount of attention had been given to this point and that the difficulty had been something elucidated let us suppose that these corpses do not actually stir from their tombs that only the ghosts or spirits appear to the living wherefor do these phantoms present themselves and what is it that energizes them is it actually the soul of the dead man which has not yet departed to its final destination or is it a demon who causes them to be seen in an assumed and phantastical body and if there bodies are spectral how do they suck the blood of the living we are enmeshed in a sad dilemma when we ask if these apparitions are natural or miraculous p 172 a priest who is recognized as possessing intellectual qualities far beyond the ordinary told me that some little time since when he was travelling in moravia mgr jeanin a canon of the cathedral of olmutz asked for his company to a village named liebava which the good canon was officially about to visit as commissary of the episcopal court to investigate the wellauthenticated reports concerning a vampire who had recently caused much trouble and disorder in the village liebava they journeyed thither witnesses were cited and heard the ordinary canonical procedure was observed in every detail the witnesses gave evidence that a certain wellknown citizen who had formerly resided at liebava after his death had sorely tormented the whole district inasmuch as for a space of three or four years he had issued forth from the cemetery and had entered several houses it was true these visitations were now ceased because a certain hungarian who passed through the village at the time when the terror was at its height avowed that he could cope with the evil and lay the vampire to rest in order to fulfil his promise he mounted the clocktower of the church and watched for the moment when the vampire came out of his grave leaving behind him in the tomb his shroud and cerements before he made his way to the village to plague and terrify the inhabitants when the hungarian from his coin of vantage had seen the vampire depart on his prowl he promptly descended from the tower possessed himself of the shroud and linen carrying them off with him back to the belfry the vampire in due course returned and not finding his sereclothes cried out mightily against the thief who from the top of the belfry was making signs to him that he should climb and recover his windingsheet if be wished to get it back again the vampire accordingly began to clamber up the steep stair which led to the summit of the tower but the hungarian suddenly gave him such a blow that he fell from top to bottom thereupon they were able to strike off his head with the sharp edge of a sextons spade and that made an end of the whole business the priest who related this history to me himself saw nothing of these happenings neither was anything witnessed p 173 by the right reverend canon who was acting as episcopal commissioner they only received the reports of the peasants of that district a folk who were very ignorant very credulous very superstitious and brimful of all kinds of wonderful stories concerning the aforesaid vampire for my part i think the whole history vain and utterly without foundation and the more absurd and contradictory are the various tales which were told the more strongly am i confirmed in the opinion which i have formed supposing indeed there were any truth in the accounts of these appearances of vampires are they to be attributed to the power of god to the angels to the souls of those who return in this way or to the devil if we adopt the last hypothesis it follows that the devil can endue these corpses with subtilty and bestow upon them the power of passing through the earth without any disturbances of the ground of gliding through the cracks and joints of a door of slipping through a keyhole of increasing of diminishing of becoming rarified as air or water to penetrate the earth in fine of enjoying the same properties as we believe will be possessed by the blessed after the resurrection and which distinguished the human body of our lord after the first easter day inasmuch as he appeared to those to whom he would show himself for jesus cometh the doors bein shut and stood in the midst and said peace be to you jesus uenit ianuis clausis s john xx 26 yet even if it be allowed that the devil can reenergize dead bodies and give them movement for a certain time can he also bestow these powers of increasing diminishing becoming rarified and so subtle that they can penetrate the earth doors windows we are not told that god allows him the exercise of any such power and it is hard to believe that a material body gross and substantial can be endowed with this subtility and spirituality without some destruction or alteration of the general structure and without damage to the configuration of the body but this would not be in accord with the intention of the devil for such a change would prevent this body from appearing from manifesting itself from motion and speech ay indeed from being eventually cut to pieces and burned as so often happens in the case of vampires in moravia poland and silesia p 174 these difficulties which dom calmet with little perception has raised can be very briefly answered and they are not only superficial but also smack of heterodoxy in the first place the story that he tells is far from satisfactory and even if it werewhat it may bemuch exaggerated one can hardly brush aside the vast vampire tradition because one instance proves to be overdrawn in any case the business of the watcher from the belfry and the demand that the vampire should regain his shroud by climbing the stairs to the top of the tower do not bear the mark of truth but what is certainly significant is that the vampire was decapitated and that then the hauntings ceased i conceive that the story of the cerements is mere elaboration but that the grave of the vampire was traced opened and that his head was severed from his body this eliminates some highly charged details whilst it does not touch the facts of the case so we see that the story when divested of these trappings offers nothing impossible that is to say nothing extraordinary or unusual in such histories dom calmet asks are the appearances of vampires to be attributed to god or to the souls of those who return or to the devil i answer that for the hauntings of a vampire three things are necessary the vampire the devil and the permission of almighty god just as we know for we learn this from the malleus maleficarum that there are three necessary concomitants of witchcraft and these are the devil a witch and the permission of almighty god part 1 so are these three necessary concomitants of vampirism whether it be the demon who is energizing the corpse or whether it be the dead man himself who by some dispensation of divine providence has returned is a particular which must be decided severally for each case so much then for dom calmets question to whom are the appearances of vampires to be attributed can the devil endow a body with these qualities of subtilty rarification increase and diminishing so that it may pass through doors and windows i answer that there is no doubt the demon can do this and to deny the proposition is hardly orthodox for s thomas says of the devil that just as he can from the air compose a body of any form and shape and assume it so as to appear in it visibly so in the same way p 175 he can clothe any corporeal thing with any corporeal form so as to appear therein moreover almost any séance will be sufficient reply to dom calmets question in his modern spiritism 1904 mr t godfrey raupert says photographs or small drawingroom ornaments have thus been seen to change their places and articles kept in a room other than that occupied by the sensitive have been brought through closed doors and deposited at a spot previously indicatedin some instances placed into the hands of the person requesting the apport of the article many such remarkable instances of apport and of matter passing through matter have been observed under the strictest possible test conditions and will be found recorded in the late leipzig professor zoellners deeply interesting work transcendental physics the writer has himself observed one instance of this kind in a private house and in circumstances entirely precluding the possibility of deception there is perhaps no phenomenon which so distinctly exhibits the action of extraneous and independent intelligence as this one pp 3536 matter then can pass through matter and the séance answers dom calmet we may if we will adopt the ectoplasmic theory to explain the mode whereby the vampire issues from his grave but although this is very probably true in some instances at all events it is not necessarily the only solution of the problem according to catholic theologians evil spirits if permitted to materialize their invisible presence to build up a tangible and active body do not absolutely require the ectoplasm of some medium not very dissimilar to the dilemma of dom calmet are the views hold by an eminent authority dr herbert mayo who was sometime senior surgeon of middlesex hospital professor of anatomy and physiology in kings college professor of comparative anatomy in the royal college of surgeons london in his wellknown work on the truths contained in popular superstitions he devotes his second letter or rather chapter to vampyrism concerning which he says the proper place of this subject falls in the midst of a philosophical disquisition but he adds for the benefit of the inquirer that it is a point on which in my time schoolboys much your juniors entertained decided opinions he continues to inform us that during the middle of the eighteenth p 176 century vampyrism spread like a pestilence through servia and wallachia causing numerous deaths and disturbing all the land with fear of the mysterious visitation against which no one felt himself secure here is something like a good solid practical popular delusion do i believe it to be sure i do the facts are matter of history the people died like rotten sheep and the cause and method of their dying was in their belief what has just been stated you suppose then they died frightened out of their lives as men have died whose pardon has been proclaimed when their necks were already on the block of the belief that they were going to die well if that were all the subject would still be worth examining but there is more in it than that he then gives an account in very full detail of a vampire at belgrade in the year 1732 he describes the circumstances in which the body was disinterred it leaned to one side the skin was fresh and ruddy the nails grown long and evilly crooked the mouth slobbered with blood from its last nights repast accordingly a stake was driven through the chest of the vampire who uttered a terrible screech whilst blood poured in quantities from the wound then it was burned to ashes moreover a number of other persons throughout the district had been infected with vampirism of the facts there can be no question whatsoever the documents are above suspicion and in particular the most important of these which was signed by three regimental surgeons and formally countersigned by a lieutenantcolonel and sublieutenant even dr mayo is obliged to allow no doubt can be entertained of its authenticity or of its general fidelity the less that it does not stand alone but is supported by a mass of evidence to the same effect it appears to establish beyond question that where the fear of vampyrism prevails and there occur several deaths in the popular belief connected with it the bodies when disinterred weeks after burial present the appearance of corpses from which life has only recently departed it is very instructive to note how the writer proceeds with the greatest subtility and no little cleverness to extract himself from logical consequences it might have seemed impossible to avoid and how he explains an exceptional circumstance by circumstances which are far more p 177 amazing and difficult to believe with the utmost suavity and breadth of mind he continues what inference shall we draw from this factthat vampyrism is true in the popular senseand that these freshlooking and wellconditioned corpses had some mysterious source of preternatural nourishment that would be to adopt not to solve the superstition let us content ourselves with a notion not so monstrous but still startling enough that the bodies which were found in the socalled vampyr state instead of being in a new or mystical condition were simply alive in the common way or had been so for some time subsequently to their interment that in short they were the bodies of persons who had been buried alive and whose life where it yet lingered was finally extinguished through the ignorance and barbarity of those who disinterred them    we have thus succeeded in interpreting one of the unknown terms in the vampyrtheorem the suspicious character who had some dark way of nourishing himself in the grave turns out to be an unfortunate gentleman or lady whom his friends had buried under a mistake while he was still alive and who if they afterwards mercifully let him alone died sooner or later either naturally or of the premature intermentin either case it is to be hoped with no interval of restored consciousness i submit that dr mayo has not succeeded in solving any difficulty at all connected with vampirism no doubt as we have already considered in some detail cases of premature burial which were far more common than was generally supposed would have helped to swell the tradition but that they can have originated it is impossible and it is absurd to put forward the terrible accident of premature burial as an explanation to cover all the facts it is quite impossible that a person who had been interred when in a coma or trance should have survived in the grave before we deal with the signs by which it is reputed a vampire may be recognized the method in which a vampire presumably leaves his grave and the way by which a vampire may be released or destroyed we will briefly inquire into dr mayos explanation of the actual visit of the vampire to a victim and the subsequent consequences the terrible anæmia and hæmoplegia which may result in death followed by the vampire infection and here we find that dr mayo p 178 quite honestly and frankly confesses that he is completely at a loss to give any solution of the difficulty it is most instructive to read those inconclusive pleas which he is driven to put forward but which his own good sense cannot accept he writes the second element which we have yet to explain is the vampyr visit and its consequencesthe lapse of the party visited into deathtrance there are two ways of dealing with this knot one is to cut it the other to untie it it may be cut by denying the supposed connexion between the vampyr visit and the supervention of deathtrance in the second party nor is the explanation thus obtained devoid of plausibility there is no reason why deathtrance should not in certain persons and places be epidemic then the persons most liable to it would be those of weak and irritable nervous systems again a first effect of the epidemic might be further to shake the nerves of weaker subjects these are exactly the persons who are likely to be infected with imaginary terrors and to dream or even to fancy they have seen mr or mrs such a one the last victim of the epidemic the dream or impression upon the senses might again recur and the sickening patient have already talked of it to his neighbours before he himself was seized with deathtrance on this supposition the vampyr visit would sink into the subordinate rank of a mere premonitory symptom to myself i must confess this explanation the best i am yet in a position to offer appears barren and jejune and not at all to do justice to the force and frequency or as tradition represents the matter the universality of the vampyr visit as a precursor of the victims fate imagine how strong must have been the conviction of the reality of the apparition how common a feature it must have been to have led to the laying down of the unnatural and repulsive process customarily followed at the vampyrs grave as the regular and proper preventive of ulterior consequences dr mayo proposes therefore to try and untie this knot a result which he singularly fails to achieve he quite erroneously states in popular language it was the ghost of the vampyr that haunted its future victim this is exactly what the vampire is not as we have seen there is some divergence of view whether the vampire is the actual person energized with some horrible mystical life in death p 179 who visits his victims and there can be no doubt at all that this is the true and proper vampire or whether it is a demon who animates and informs the body but in no circumstances whatsoever is the vampire a phantom or ghost save by a quite inadmissible extension of the term which then may practically be regarded as indeed it is often most mistakenly and reprehensively regarded as covering almost any malignant supernatural phenomenon so an explanation which confuses a vampire with a ghost is entirely impertinent we will now proceed to inquire into those physical traits by which a vampire may be discerned a vampire is generally described as being exceedingly gaunt and lean with a hideous countenance and eyes wherein are glinting the red fire of perdition when however he has satiated his lust for warm human blood his body becomes horribly puffed and bloated as though he were some great leech gorged and replete to bursting cold as ice or it may be fevered and burning as a hot coal the skin is deathly pale but the lips are very full and rich blub and red the teeth white and gleaming and the canine teeth wherewith he bites deep into the neck of his prey to suck thence the vital streams which reanimate his body and invigorate all his forces appear notably sharp and pointed often his mouth curls back in a vulpine snarl which bares these fangs a gaping mouth and gleaming teeth says leone allacci and so in many districts the harelipped are avoided as being certainly vampires in bulgaria it is thought that the vampire who returns from the tomb has only one nostril and in certain districts of poland he is supposed to have a sharp point at the end of his tongue like the sting of a bee it is said that the palms of a vampires hands are downy with hair and the nails are always curved and crooked often wellnigh the length of a great birds claw the quicks dirty and foul with clots and gouts of black blood his breath is unbearably fetid and rank with corruption the stench of the charnel dr henry more in his an antidote against atheism iii ix tells us that when johannes cuntius an alderman of pentsch in silesia and a witch returned as a vampire he much tormented the parson of the parish one evening when this theologer was sitting with his wife and children about him exercising himself in musick according p 180 to his usual manner a most grievous stink arose suddenly which by degrees spread itself to every corner of the room here upon he commends himself and his family to god by prayer the smell nevertheless encreased and became above all measure pestilently noisom insomuch that he was forced to go up to his chamber he and his wife had not been in bed a quarter of an hour but they find the same stink in the bedchamber of which while they are complaining one to another out steps the spectre from the wall and creeping to his bedside breathes upon him an exceeding cold breath of so intolerable stinking and malignant a scent as is beyond all imagination and expression here upon the theologer good soul grew very ill and was fain to keep his bed his face belly and guts swelling as if he had been poysoned whence he was also troubled with a difficulty of breathing and with a putrid inflamation of his eyes so that he could not well use them of a long time after in the malleus maleficarum part ii qn 1 ch 11 the following is related in the territory of the black forest a witch was being lifted by a gaoler on to the pile of wood prepared for her burning and said i will pay you and blew into his face and he was at once afflicted with a horrible leprosy all over his body and did not survive many days boguet discours des sorciers gives as his rubric to chapter xxv si les sorciers tuent de leur

with man or woman most authorities answer that the demon assumes or animates the corpse of another human being male or female as the case may be and delrio p 181 disquisitiones magicae liber ii q xxviii sec 1 comments denique multae falsae resurrectiones gentilium huc sunt referendae  constat cum sagis ut plurimum induto cadauere diabolum sine incubum sine succubum rem habere unde  in hoc genere hominum cadauerosus quidam faetor graueolentiae cernitur some remoter country districts indeed are apt to regard any poor wretch who is sadly deformed as a vampire especially if the distortion be altogether unsightly prominent or grotesque it has even been known that a peasant whose face was deeply marked with winecoloured pigment owing it was thought to some accident which befell his mother during her late pregnancy was shunned and suspected of being a malignant vrykolakas chorea they say is a certain sign of vampirism and it may be remarked that in shoa this disorder is regarded as the result of demoniacal possession or due to the magic spell of an enemys shadow having fallen upon the sufferer an epileptic there is also often considered as being in the power of some devil and unless proper precautions are taken he will assuredly not rest in his grave the vampire is endowed with strength and agility more than human and he can run with excessive speed outstripping the wind it is curious to find that in many countries persons with blue eyes are considered extremely liable to become vampires this is the case in some parts of greece but there does not seem to be preserved any oral tradition to explain the particular belief it may of course have arisen owing to the fact that persons with eyes of this colour would seldom if over have been met with and a stranger with blue eyes would be regarded with wonder and awe thus in ireland persons with bluishgrey eyes especially if there be a streak of black on the pupil which is common are accounted to have the power of seeing ghosts we cannot i think connect the greek idea with the homeric epithet for the goddess athene γλαυκῶπις which has been rendered brighteyed greyeyed or blueeyed an old interpretation that proves utterly erroneous since there can be no doubt that γλαυκῶπις means owlfaced γλαύξ and originally athene was a deity who was literally imagined and represented as having the face of an owl even if she did not as is most probable p 182 actually appear in the shape of an owl among the australian aborigines the owl is regarded as a sex totem of women and is most jealously protected by them we find too that the owl is a sacred bird among the indians of northwest america and in their ritual dances a solemnity revealed to them as they suppose by their guardian spirits wherein they mime ancient story the masqueraders often personate by dress voice and gesture the owl the dukwally ie lokoala and other tamanawas performances are exhibitions intended to represent incidents connected with their mythological legends   an indian for instance who has been consulting with his guardian spirit which is done by going through the washing and fasting process before described will imagine or think he is called upon to represent the owl he arranges in his mind the style of dress the number of performers the songs and dances or other movements and having the plan perfected announces at a tamanawas meeting that he has had a revelation which he will impart to a select few these are then taught and drilled in strict secrecy and when they have perfected themselves will suddenly make their appearance and perform before the astonished tribe the owl gives mystic qualities for in northern india it is believed that a man who eats the eyes of an owl will be able to see even as that bird in the dark in nigeria the owl is regarded with great awe and the natives tremble even to pronounce its name on account of the ill omen preferring to speak of the bird that makes one afraid it may be remembered that vampires are credited with being able to see in the dark and that in many countries peasants dread to utter the word employing some elaborate and often not very intelligible periphrasis those whose hair is red of a certain peculiar shade are unmistakably vampires it is significant that in ancient egypt as manetho tells us human sacrifices were offered at the grave of osiris and the victims were redhaired men who were burned their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowingfans it is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest redhair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn but these men were called typhonians and were representatives not of osiris but of his evil rival typhon whose hair p 183 was red francesco redi says fra gli egizii era tradizione che tifone il genio della distruzione simile al arimane persiano al satano ebriaco fosse di pelo rosso forse per memoria di invasioni di barbari di pelo rosso e presso noi dura tutta via la tradizione guardati dal pelo rosso nè valse a toglierla la barba rossa del redentore red was the colour of the hair of judas iscariot and of cain and an old latin rhyme of the thirteenth century has monet nos haec fabula rufos euitare quos color et fama notat illis sociare the italians say capelli rossi o tutto foco o tutto mosci john wodroephe in the spared hours of a soldier in hie travels dort 1623 quotes garde toi bien des hommes rousseaux des femmes barbues et des ceux qui sont marqués an visage i have not met with the following tradition save orally but it is believed in serbia bulgaria and rumania that there are certain redpolled vampires who are called children of judas and that these the foulest of the foul kill their victim with one bite or kiss which drains the blood as it were at a single draught the poisoned flesh of the victim is wounded with the devils stigmata three hideous scars shaped thus xxx signifying the thirty pieces of silver the price of blood it is curious to note that the ancient ideas of the physiognomy of amorous persons are not at all unlike the distinctive marks of the vampire the old belief has thus been summed up by g tourdes aphrodisie dictionnaire encyclopédique des sciences médicales the erotic temperament has been described as marked by a lean figure white and wellranged teeth a developed hairy system a characteristic voice air and expression and even a special odour since the vampire bites his prey with sharp teeth and greedily sucks forth the blood it is not surprising to find that those who are born with teeth in their heads are considered to be already marked down as vampires even in countries where the vampire belief was lost this circumstance was considered of the unluckiest and in chapman and shirleys p 184 chabot admiral of france v 2 master advocate exposing the villainies of the chancellor declares he was born with teeth in his head by an affidavit of his midwife to note his devouring and hath one toe on his left foot crooked and in the form of an eagles talon to foretel his rapacity what shall i say branded marked and designed in his birth for shame and obloquy which appeareth further by a mole under his right ear with only three witchs hairs in it strange and ominious predictions of nature according to allacci those children who were thought likely to become callicantzari were taken to a fire which had been lighted in the marketsquare and here the soles of their feet were held to the flames until the nails were singed and the danger of their attacks averted the allusion in chabot to the toe on his left foot crooked and in the form of an eagles talon is particularly interesting in this connexion it is evident that the old physical characteristics which mark a creature of demoniacal propensities had been remembered as of illomen and horror when exactly what they portended and betrayed had been lost in the mists of ancient lore moreover it should be noted that persons and animals attack with the hands or the claws not generally with the feet to scratch and rend accordingly the custom in the days even of allacci was practised but not understood and it points to some belief reaching back to old greek mythology it is probably some link between the callicantzaros and the centaurs as lawson suggests in wellfounded detail the vampire is as we have said generally believed to embrace his victim who has been thrown into a trancelike sleep and after greedily kissing the throat suddenly to bite deep into the jugular vein and absorb the warm crimson blood it has long since been recognized by medicopsychologists that there exists a definite connexion between the fascination of blood and sexual excitation owing to custom to inhibitions and education this emotion generally remains latent although a certain mental sadism is by no means a mark of degeneracy dr havelock ellis says it is probable that the motive of sexual murders is nearly always to shed blood and not to cause death an extremely significant fact since the vampire is generally held to seize the throat it is very striking that leppmann points out p 185 that such murders are almost always produced by wounds in the neck or mutilation of the abdomen never by wounds of the head paul denjoy defines the kiss as a bite and a suction and a high authority says the impulse to bite is also a part of the tactile element which lies at the origin of kissing the tactile kiss which doubtless is very primitive has developed into the olfactory and gustatory extending thence into many elaborations and variants under the stress of strong sexual emotion when love is closely knit with pain there is often an overwhelming tendency to bite the partner of the act and the lovebite is often referred to in latin literature thus plautus pseudolus i 1 ll 6266 speaks of amorous dalliance nunc nostri amores mores consuetudines iocus

references to be found in such manual as the arabic perfumed garden of the sheik nefzaoui when it is borne in mind how markedly slavonic a tradition is the bite of the vampire it becomes extremely significant to know that biting in amorous embraces is very common among the southern slavs the peasant women of sicily especially says alonzi in the districts where crimes of blood are prevalent often in their affection for their children kiss them violently even biting them and sucking their blood until the infant wails in pain if a child has done wrong they will not only strike it but also bite it fiercely on the face ears or arms till blood flows both men and women often use the threat i will drink p 188 your blood there is ocular evidence that a man who had knifed another in a quarrel licked the hot blood from the victims hand a very curious case was reported in the london police news of 1894 a man aged thirty was charged with illtreating his wifes illegitimate daughter aged three the acts had lasted over a period of many months her lips eyes and hands were bitten and covered with bruises from sucking and often her little pinafore was stained with blood defendant admitted he had bitten the child because he loved it here we have true vampirish qualities and inclinations the daily express 17th april 1925 gave the following vampire brain plan to preserve it for science

exceptional character of the crimesmost of haarmanns victims were bitten to deaththe case aroused tremendous interest among german scientists it is probable that haarmanns brain will be removed and preserved by the university authoritiescentral news the case of fritz haarmann who was dubbed the hanover vampire was reported in some detail in the news of the world 21st december 1924 under the heading vampires victims haarmann was born in hanover 26th october 1879 the father olle harmann a locomotivestoker was wellknown as a rough crossgrained choleric man whom fritz his youngest son both hated and feared as a youth fritz haarmann was educated at a church school and then at a preparatory school for noncommissioned officers at new breisach it is significant that he was always dull and stupid unable to learn but it appears a good soldier when released from military service owing to illhealth he returned home only to be accused in a short while of offences against children being considered irresponsible for his actions the court sent him to an asylum at hildesheim whence however he managed to escape and took refuge in switzerland later he returned to hanover but the house became unbearable owing to the violent quarrels which were of daily occurrence between him and his father accordingly he enlisted and was p 189 sent to the crack 10th jäger battalion at colmar in alsace here he won golden opinions and when released owing to illness with a pension his papers were marked recht gut when he reached home there were fresh scenes of rancour whilst blows were not infrequently exchanged and in 1903 he was examined by a medical expert dr andrae who considered him morally lacking but yet there were no grounds for sending him to an asylum before long he sank to the status of a tramp a street hawker at times a pilferer and a thief again and again he was sent to jail now charged with larceny now with burglary now with indecency now with fraud in 1918 he was released after a long stretch to find another germany he returned to hanover and was able to open a small cook shop in the old quarter of the town where he also hawked meat which was eagerly sought at a time of general hunger and scarcity he drove yet another trade that of coppers nark an old lag who had turned spy and informer who gave secret tips to the police as to the whereabouts of men they wanted detective haarmann he was nicknamed by the women who thronged his shop because he always had plenty of fresh meat in store and he invariably contrived to undersell the other butchers and victuallers of the quarter the centre of hanover was the great railway station and hanover was thronged especially at its centre with a vast evermoving population fugitive wanderers and homeless from all parts of dislocated germany runaway lads from towns in every direction made their way here looking for work looking for food idly tramping without any definite object without any definite goal because they had nothing else to do it can well be imagined that the police a hopelessly inadequate force kept as sharp a watch as possible on the station and its purlieus and haarmann used to help them in their surveyance at midnight or in the early morning he would walk up and down among the rows of huddled sleeping forms in the thirdclass waiting halls and suddenly waking up some frightened youngster demand to see his ticket ask to know whence he had come and where he was going some sad story would be sobbed out and the kindly haarmann was wont to offer a mattress and a meal in his own place down town p 190 so far as could be traced the first boy he so charitably took to his rooms was a lad of seventeen named friedel rothe who had run away from home on 29th september 1918 his mother received a postcard and it so happened the very same day his father returned from the war the parents were not going to let their son disappear without a search and they soon began to hunt for him in real earnest one of friedels pals told them that the missing boy had met a detective who offered him shelter other clues were traced and with extraordinary trouble for the authorities had more pressing matters in hand than tracking truant schoolboys the family obliged the police to search cellarstrasse 27 where haarmann lived when a sudden entry was made haarmann was found with another boy in such an unequivocal situation that his friends the police were obliged to arrest him there and then and he received nine months imprisonment for gross indecency under section 175 of the german code four years later when haarmann was awaiting trial for twentyfour murders he remarked at the time when the policeman arrested me the head of the boy friedel rothe was hidden under a newspaper behind the oven later on i threw it into the canal in september 1919 haarmann first met hans grans the handsome lad who was to stand beside him in the dock grans the type of abnormal and dangerous decadent which is only too common today was one of the foulest parasites of society pilferer and thief bully informer spy agent provocateur murderer renter prostitute and what is lower and fouler than all blackmailer the influence of this ganymede over haarmann was complete it was he who instigated many of the murdersadolf harmappel a lad of seventeen was killed in november 1923 because grans wanted his pair of new trousers ernst spiecker likewise aged seventeen was killed on 5th january 1924 because grans coveted his toff shirtit was he who arranged the details who very often trapped the prey it may be said that in 1918 hanover a town of 450000 inhabitants was wellknown as being markedly homosexual these were inscribed on the police lists no less than 500 männliche prostituierten of whom the comeliest and bestdressed the mannered and wellbehaved elegants frequented p 191 the café kröpeke in the georgstrasse one of the first boulevards of new hanover whilst others met their friends at the andrygonous balls in the kalenberger vorstadt or in the old assembly rooms and lowest of all there was a tiny dancingplace zur schwülen guste hotstuff gussies where poor boys found their clientele it was here for example that grans picked up young ernst spiecker whose tawdry shirt cost him his life with regard to his demeanour at the trial the contemporary newspapers write throughout the long ordeal haarmann was utterly impassive and complacent   the details of the atrocious crimes for which haarmann will shortly pay with his life were extremely revolting all his victims were between 12 and 18 years of age and it was proved that accused actually sold the flesh for human consumption he once made sausages in his kitchen and together with the purchaser cooked and ate them   some alienists hold that even then the twentyfour murders cannot possibly exhaust the full toll of haarmanns atrocious crimes and estimate the total as high as fifty with the exception of a few counts the prisoner made minutely detailed confessions and for days the court listened to his grim narrative of how he cut up the bodies of his victims and disposed of the fragments in various ways he consistently repudiated the imputation of insanity but at the same time maintained unhesitatingly that all the murders were committed when he was in a state of trance and unaware of what he was doing this contention was specifically brushed aside by the bench which in its judgement pointed out that according to his own account of what happened it was necessary for him to hold down his victims by hand in a peculiar way before it was possible for him to inflict a fatal bite on their throats such action necessarily involved some degree of deliberation and conscious purpose another account says with regard to haarmann the killing of altogether twentyseven young men is laid at his door the horror of the deeds being magnified by the allegation that he sold to customers for consumption the flesh of those he did not himself eat   with haarmann in the dock appeared a younger man his friend hans grans first accused of assisting in the actual murders but now charged with inciting to commit them and with receiving stolen p 192 property the police are still hunting for a third man charles also a butcher who is alleged to have completed the monstrous trio    the prosecuting attorney has an array of nearly 200 witnesses to prove that all the missing youths were done to death in the same horrible way   he would take them to his rooms and after a copious meal would praise the looks of his young guests then he would kill them after the fashion of a vampire their clothes he would put up on sale in his shop and the bodies would be cut up and disposed of with the assistance of charles in open court however haarmann admitted that grans often used to select his victims for him more than once he alleged grans beat him for failing to kill the game brought in and haarmann would keep the corpses in a cupboard until they could be got rid of and one day the police were actually in his rooms when there was a body awaiting dismemberment the back of the place abutted on the river and the bones and skulls were thrown into the water some of them were discovered but their origin was a mystery until a police inspector paid a surprise visit to prisoners home to inquire into a dispute between haarmann and an intended victim who escaped suspicion had at last fallen upon him principally owing to skulls and bones found in the river seine during may june and july 1924 the newspapers said that during 1924 no less than 600 persons had disappeared for the most part lads between 14 and 18 on the night of 22nd june at the railway station sometime after midnight a quarrel broke out between haarmann and a young fellow named fromm who accused him of indecency both were taken to the central station and meanwhile haarmanns room in the red row was thoroughly examined with the result that damning evidence came to light before long he accused grans as his accomplice since at the moment they happened to be on bad terms haarmann was sentenced to be decapitated a sentence executed with a heavy sword grans was condemned to imprisonment for life afterwards commuted to twelve years penal servitude in accordance with the law haarmann was put to death on wednesday 15th april 1925 this is probably one of the most extraordinary cases of vampirism known the violent eroticism the fatal bite in p 193 the throat are typical of the vampire and it was perhaps something more than mere coincidence that the mode of execution should be the severing of the head from the body since this was one of the efficacious methods of destroying a vampire certainly in the extended sense of the word as it is now so commonly used fritz haarmann was a vampire in every particular to return to the more restricted connotation we find that as has been mentioned above dom calmet in his famous work more than once emphasized that his great difficulty in accepting the tradition of the vampire that is to say the vampire proper and not a mere malignant phantom lies in the fact that it is physically impossible for a dead body to leave its grave since he argues if it has corporeity it cannot have subtilty that is to say the power of passing through material objects accordingly in the second volume of his great treatise he gives as the rubric to chapter lx impossibilité morale que les revenans sortent de leurs tombeaux he commences i have already raised a serious objection which is the impossibility that vampires should leave their graves and should return thither without any obvious disturbance of the ground either when they are passing forth or when they are finding their way back again nobody has ever met this difficulty and nobody ever will be able to meet it to maintain that the devil subtilizes and renders unsubstantial the body of the vampire is merely an assertion which is made without any foundation and which is unsustained and untrue the fluidity of the blood the healthy red colour and the absence of rigidity in the case of vampires are not circumstances which need cause us the slightest wonder any more than the fact that the hair grows and the bodies remain without dissolution it is a matter of daily occurrence that bodies are found which do not crumble to dust and which for a very long time after death preserve the appearance of life this is not in the least surprising in the cases of those who die suddenly without any illness or indeed as the consequence of certain diseases which are wellknown to medical men sicknesses which do not affect the circulation of the blood or the elasticity of the body p 194 with regard to the growth of hair this is quite a natural condition one might even compare these facts with the flowers and in general with everything which depends upon the luxuriance of vegetation among the fauna and flora of nature these objections thus stated may seem very weighty but perhaps if they are impartially examined it may be found that the good benedictine has been a little too dogmatic in his assertions the phenomenon that the soil of the grave was almost invariably undisturbed by the exit of the vampire who further could make his entry through doors and windows without opening or breaking them may yet admit of an explanation which will go far to solve the difficulty don calmet and many others have regarded as insurmountable in the first place it is hardly correct so sweepingly to assert that the ground is wholly undisturbed where careful investigation was made it was generally found that there were discovered four or five little holes or tunnels not much larger indeed than a mans finger which pierced through the earth to a very considerable depth and here perhaps in this one little detail we may find the clue to the whole mystery the wide spread growth of spiritualism has made even the ordinary public fairly familiar with the phenomena of a séance where materialization takes place and where physical forms are solidly built up and disintegrated again within an exceedingly short space of time this is done by some power or entity which awails itself of the body of the passive medium and utilizes the ectoplasm which it can draw thence professor ostwald writes certain human beings are capable of transforming their physiological store of energy which as we know is almost exclusively present in the form of chemical energy of transmitting it through space and of transforming it at prescribed points back into one of the known forms of energy it results from this that the mediums themselves are usually much exhausted ie that they use up their bodily energy a transformation into psychic energy seems also to be possible the extreme exhaustion of a medium after such investigation and the production of forms of organic matter is a matter of common knowledge of one of the most famous mediums eusapia paladino it is reported eusapia during the sittings fell into a deep hysterical somnambulism and was often in p 195 slightly dazed condition after the close when the trance set in she turned pale and her head swerved to and fro and the eyes were turned upwards and inwards she was hypersensitive especially to the touch and also to light she had hallucinations delirium fits of laughter weeping or deep sleep and showed other typical hysterical convulsions digestive troubles also sometimes set in especially when she had eaten before the sitting in a sudden light or at a sudden rough touch she cried out and shuddered as she would under unexpected violent pain and again eusapia paladino used to be very exhausted after every successful sitting especially after she had been in a state of trance she sometimes slept until the next midday and was for the rest of the day apathetic peevish and monosyllabic her skin was usually cold after the sittings her pulse rapid 100 per minute and she had a strong feeling of fatigue her subsequent sleep was often restless and interrupted by vivid dreams speaking of another famous medium the same authority says in the case of eva c also where the number of negative sittings is very considerable she feels much exhausted according to the degree of her performances and after exhaustive positive sittings she usually needs from twentyeight to fortyfour hours to recover the deficit in her strength also she is often on the following day dazed and complains of headache and lack of appetite it is extremely significant and one might say even more significant that these are the very symptoms exhibited by those who have been attacked by a vampire another fact which must be borne in mind is that the vampire was often a person who during life had read deeply in poetic lore and practised black magic for the connexion between spiritism and black magic one may refer to my history of witchcraft when the matter is very amply discussed and made plain with these pregnant and remarkable details in mind we may consider the explanation of vampirism given by z t pierart a wellknown french spiritualist and sometime editor of la revue spiritualiste he writes as follows as long as the astral form is not entirely liberated from the body there is a liability that it may be forced by magnetic attraction to reenter it sometimes it will be only halfway out when p 196 the corpse which presents the appearance of death is buried in such cases the terrified astral soul reenters its casket and then one of two things happen the person buried either writhes in agony of suffocation or if he has been grossly material becomes a vampire the bicorporeal life then begins the ethereal form can go where it pleases and as long as it does not break the link connecting it with the body can wander visible or invisible and feed on its victims it then transmits the results of the suction by some mysterious invisible cord of connexion to the body thus aiding it to perpetuate the state of catalepsy duly discounting the peculiar phraseology of astral soul and ethereal form this comment seems to point towards a possible and correct explanation there remain three hypotheses to be considered does the body of the vampire actually dematerialize and then reintegrate outside the grave or is another body built up by the vampire quite independently of the body which remains behind in the grave thirdly does the spirit of the vampire withdraw ectoplasmic material from his own body which enables him to form more permanent corporeity by drawing yet further material from his victims the second of these suggestions we may dismiss without much consideration since it is not borne out by any of the facts which have been investigated with regard to the subject and the truth seems to lie between the first and the third hypotheses partaking of both the body of the vampire under certain conditions acquires subtilty and therefore it is able to pass through material objects but in order to ensure not only its vitality but the permanence of this subtile quality it must draw this energy no doubt very often in an ectoplasmic form from its victim as well as what is necessary for its rejuvenescence the continual demand which a vampire makes both physically and spiritually upon its victims must speedily result in the death of these persons who being infected with the poison will in their turn visit others upon whom they will prey it must always be remembered that the word vampire is used so loosely that there are traditions and legends which hardly require even one of these three hypotheses for their explanation and which one cannot too frequently repeat the caution refer to phantoms of the vampire family rather than to the vampire proper p 197 it certainly seems a possibility and something more than a possibility that vampiric entities may be on the watch and active to avail themselves of the chances to use the ectoplasmic emanations of mediums at séances and this certainly constitutes a very formidable danger it is even a fact that if a person who consciously or unconsciously possesses the natural qualities of a materializing medium is placed in certain nocuous circumstances for example if he visits a house which is powerfully haunted by malefic influences especially if he be fatigued and languid so as to offer little or no resistance a vampirish entity may temporarily utilize his vitality to attempt a partial materialization this seems clear from the many instances of persons who for no obvious reason are in certain spots it may be a place a house or even a room overcome with a depression which if they do not shake off by an act of will or by leaving the particular locality may develop into actual debility and enervation a very striking example of an entity who in this way made an attempt at materialization is recorded by miss scatcherd in her contribution to survival a symposium which was published under the editorial care of sir james marchant miss scatcherd relates i saw ectoplasm in solid form for the first time when looking for rooms in the neighbourhood of russell square my friend many years older than myself was tired she wore a black velvet cloak and was sitting on a high chair so that her mantle hung in long folds to the ground while the light from the large windows fell full on her face suddenly i observed on her left side just above her waist a patch of cloudy white substance becoming bigger and denser as i watched its uncanny growth meanwhile i was discussing terms with the landlady a frail little woman when a look of terror came into her eyes she too was staring transfixed at the globular mass of white substance on my companions black mantle for out of it looked a living face normal in sizea mans face with rolling eyes and leering grin that made ones blood run cold when i mentally ordered him away he grinned defiance fearing to startle my friend i took the landlady aside and asked what was the matter she burst into tears oh miss did you not see him he was my first he come like this several times and has never forgiven me for marrying again p 198 what do you mean i asked again severely oh she wailed you must have seen his wicked face glaring at us from your friends cloak and now you will not take the rooms in some traditions the vampire is said to float into the house in the form of a mist a belief which is found in countries so far separate as hungary and china in the latter empire willsothewisp are thought to be an unmistakable sign of a place where much blood has been shed such as an old battle field and all mists and gaseous marshlights are connected with the belief in vampires and spectres which convey disease since the effluvia the vapour and haze from a swamp or quaggy ground are notoriously unhealthy and malarial fevers result in delirium and anæmia it may be that in some legends the disease has been personified as a ghastly creature who rides on the infected air and sucks the life from his victims but all this is mere fancy and only deserves a passing mention as belonging to legend and story of the same nature is the notion that vampires can command destructive animals and vermin such as flies and in the east the mosquito whose bite may indeed convey some fever to the veins and whose long proboscis sucks the blood of animals and man we may remember that at accaron beelzebub was the lord of flies and these insects were often regarded as having something of a diabolical nature pausanias v14 tells us that the people of elis offered sacrifice to zeus averter of flies a ceremony which is also mentioned by clement of alexandria in his προτρεπτικὸς πρὸς ἔλληνας ii 38 ed potter p 33 pliny historia naturalis x 75 says the eleans invoke the flycatching god because the swarms of these insects breed pestilence and as soon as the sacrifice is made to the god the flies all perish pausanias viii 267 further notes that at aliphera in arcadia the festival of athene began with prayer and oblation to the flycatcher and after this rite the flies gave no more trouble aelian de animalium natura xi 8 tells us that at the festival of apollo in the island of leucas an ox was actually sacrificed to the flies who when glutted with the warm blood incontinently disappeared julius solinus in his collectanea rerum memorabilium i xi ed th mommsem berlin 1864 records that all flies were carefully excluded from the shrine of hercules p 199 in the forum bovarium at rome because when hercules was handing the flesh to the priests he had prayed aloud to the flycatcher it may be noted that when the demon under whatsoever guise or name he might be adored had received those divine honours he ever covets and filches to himself by so woefully deceiving his worshippers he withdraws his emissaries the tormenting flies who are often his imps in the form of insect by their means he has striven to vex and molest the saintss bernard by excommunicating the flies that buzzed about him struck them all down dead upon the floor of the church it now remains to inquire how the grave of a vampire may be recognized and in what way this terror may be checked and destroyed in this connexion it will not be impertinent to give a letter dun fort honnête homme et fort instruit de ce qui regarde les revenants which is cited at length by dom calmet the letter is addressed to a near relative of the writer it is your wish my dear cousin that i should give you exact details of what has been happening in hungary with regard to certain apparitions who so often molest and slay people in that part of the world i am in a position to afford you this information for i have been living for some years in those very districts and i am naturally of an inquiring disposition from the time when i was a mere boy i have heard numbers of stories of ghosts and witches but not once in a thousand have i believed one of them it seems to me that it is almost impossible to be too careful in the investigation of matters where it is so easy to be mistakenor deliberately tricked however there are certain facts so well vouched for that one cannot but accept them as true as to the apparitions of hungary this is the usual account a person is attached by a great languor and weariness he loses all appetite he visibly wastes and grows thin and at the end of a week or ten days may be a fortnight he dies without any other symptom save anæmia and emaciation in hungary they say that a vampire has attacked him and sucked his blood many of those who fall ill in this way declare that a white spectre is following them and cleaves to them as close as a shadow when we were in our kaloesabacs quarters in the county of temesvar two officers of p 200 the regiment in which i was cornet died from this languor and several more were attacked and must have perished had not a corporal of our regiment put a stop to these maladies by resorting to the remedial ceremonies which are practised by the local people these are very unusual and although they are considered an infallible cure i cannot remember even to have seen these in any rituale they select a young lad who is a pure maiden that is to say who as they believe had never performed the sexual act he is set upon a young stallion who has not yet mounted his first mare who has never stumbled and who must be coalblack without a speck of white the stud is ridden into the cemetery in and out among the graves and that grave over which the steed in spite of the blows they deal him pretty handsomely refuses to pass is where the vampire lies the tomb is opened and they find a sleek fat corpse as healthily coloured as though the man wore quietly and happily sleeping in calm repose with one single blow of a sharp spade they cut off the head whereupon there gush forth warm streams of blood in colour rich red and filling the whole grave it would assuredly be supposed that they had just decapitated a stalwart fine fellow of most sanguine habit and complexion when this business is done they refill the grave with earth and then the ravages of the disease immediately cease whilst those who are suffering from this marasmus gradually recover their strength just as convalescents recuperating after a long illness who have wasted and withered this is exactly what occurred in the case of our young officers who had sickened as the colonel of the regiment the captain and lieutenant wore all absent i happened to be in command just then and i was heartily vexed to find that the corporal had arranged the affair without my knowledge i was within an ace of ordering him a severe military punishment and these are common enough in the imperial service i would have given the world to have been present at the exhumation of the vampire but after all it is too late f or that now it has already been remarked that in a cemetery there were often found to be a number of small passages of the size of a mans finger pierced through the earth and it was considered that the presence of such a soupirail in a grave was a certain p 201 sign that if investigation were made a body with all the marks of vampirism would be descovered lying there when the corpse is exhumed even though death has taken place long before there will be no decay no trace of corruption or decomposition but rather it will be found to be plump and of a clear complexion the face often ruddy the whole person composed as if in a profound sleep sometimes the eyes are closed more frequently open glazed fixed and glaring fiercely the lips which will be markedly full and red are drawn back from the teeth which gleam long sharp as razors and ivory white often the gaping mouth is stained and foul with great slab gouts of blood which trickles down from the corners on to the lawn shroudings and linen cerements the offal of the last nights feast in the case of an epidemic of vampirism it is recorded that whole graves have been discovered soaked and saturated with squelching blood which the horrid inhabitant has gorged until he is replete and vomited forth in great quantities like some swollen leech discharges when thrown into the brine in greece it is thought that the corpses skin becomes exceedingly tough and distended so that the joints can hardly be bent the human pelt has stretched like the vellum tegument of a drum and when struck returns the same sound whence the greek vrykolakas has received the name τυμπανιαῖος drumlike it was not infrequently seen that the dead person in his grave had devoured all about him grinding them with his teeth and as it was supposed uttering a low raucous noise like the grunting of a pig who roots among garbage in his work de masticatione mortuorum in tumulis leipzig 1728 michael ranft treats at some length of this matter he says that it is very certain that some corpses have devoured their cerements and even gnaw their own flesh it has been suggested that this is the original reason why the jaws of the dead were tightly bound with linen bands ranft instances the case of a bohemian woman who when disinterred in 1355 had devoured the greater part of her shroud in another instance during the sixteenth century both a man and a woman seemed to have torn out their intestines and were actually ravening upon their entrails in moravia a corpse was exhumed which had devoured the graveclothes of a woman buried not far from his tomb p 202 the authors of the malleus maleficarum part i question xv under the rubric it is shown that on account of the sins of witches the innocent are often bewitched yea sometimes even for their own sins relate an instance which came under their own observation they say also the sin of one is passed on to another in the way of desert as when the sins of wicked subjects are passed on to a bad governor because the sins of the subjects deserve a bad governor see job he makes hypocrites to reign on account of the sins of the people sin and consequently punishment can also be passed on through some consent or dissimulation for when those in authority neglect to reprove sin then very often the good are punished with the wicked as s augustine says in the first book de ciuitate dei an example was brought to our notice as inquisitors a town once was rendered almost destitute by the death of its citizens and there was a rumour that a certain buried woman was gradually eating the shroud in which she had been buried and that the plague could not cease until she had eaten the whole shroud and absorbed it into her stomach a council was held and the podesta with the governor of the city dug up the grave and found half the shroud absorbed through the mouth and throat into the stomach and consumed in horror at this sight the podesta drew his sword and cut off her head and threw it out of the grave and at once the plague ceased now the sins of that old woman were by divine permission visited upon the innocent on account of the dissimulation of what had happened before for when an inquisition was held it was found that during a long time of her life she had been a sorceress and enchantress if it were suspected that a man might return as a vampire or that his ghost would prove troublesome precautions were taken to prevent this in the first place the grave must be dug twice as deep as usual indeed in oldenburg the chances are that if the grave be shallow any ghost may walk the chuwashé a tribe in finland actually nail the corpse to the coffin the burmese tie together the two big toes and usually also the two thumbs of the corpse the arabs fasten the feet in voigtland it is considered sufficient to secure the hands the californians and damasas break the dead mans spine in his travels into dalmatia english p 203 translation london 1778 alberto fortis says when a man dies suspected of becoming a vampire or vukodlak as they call it they cut his hams and prick his whole body with pins pretending that after this operation he cannot walk about these are even instances of morlacchi who imagining that they may possibly thirst for childrens blood after death intreat their heirs and sometimes oblige them to promise to treat them as vampires when they die when the vampire was tracked to his lair one of the most approved methods to render him harmless was to transfix the corpse through the region of the heart with a stake which may be of aspen or maple as in russia or more usually of hawthorn or whitethorn the aspen tree is held to be particularly sacred as according to one account of this was the wood of the cross in her woodwalk mrs felicia hemans says the aspentree shivers mystically in sympathy with the horror of that mothertree in palestine which was compelled to furnish materials for the cross with regard to hawthorn de la charbonelais chesnil tells us cet arbre est regardé comme

that branches of whitethorn or buckthorn rhamnus fastened to a door or outside a window prevented the entry of witches and guarded the house against the evil spells of sorcerers hence they suspended branches of it above their lintels when sacrifices p 204 were offered for the dead lost haply any vagrom ghost should be tempted to revisit his old home or make entry into the house of some other person the atheist bion as atheists use when he was dying clutched at any superstition and asked for boughs of buckthorn and branches of laurel to be attached to the door to keep out death it should be remarked that the old greek custom is widely practised among the peasantry of europe today and in fletchers the faithfull shepherdesse ii when clorin is sorting her herbs she says these rhamnus

albania for the wooden stake is sometimes substituted a consecrated dagger a poniard which has been laid upon the altar and ritually blessed by the priest with due sacring of holy orison of frankincense and lustral asperges it is highly important that the body of the vampire should be transfixed by a single blow for two blows or three would restore it to life this curious idea is almost universally found in tradition and folklore in the thousand and one nights burton vol vii p 361 we have the story of sayfalmuluk and badion al jamal where the hero cuts the ghoul in half by a single stroke through the waist the ghost yells at him oman an thou desire to slay me strike me a second stroke the youth is just about to give the second slash with his scimitar when a certain old blind

vampire he will utter the most terrible shrieks and blood will jet forth in every direction from his convulsed and writhing limbs as he impotently threshes the air with his quivering hands there is a tradition that when he has been dead for many years and his mysterious life in death is thus ended the corpse has been known immediately to crumble into dust in some countries this operation usually takes place soon after dawn as the vampire may only leave his grave with the dusk and must return at cockcrow so he will be caught when he has come back torpid and heavy from his nights banquet of blood but as we have mentioned in another place this belief that his ravages are confined to the dark hours is by no means universal for paul lucas in his voyage au levant speaking of corfu says des personnes qui paroissent avoir le bon sons parlent dun fait assez singulier qui arrive souvent en ce pays aussi bien que dans lisle santeriny des gens morts disentils reviennent se font voir en plein

wallachians leave his tomb on a saturday many believe that even in the daytime it is only once a week on the saturday that he is allowed to occupy his burialplace when it is discovered that such a vurvúlukas is about the people go on a saturday and open his tomb when they always find his body just as it was buried and entirely undecomposed tozer researches in the highlands of turkey ii p 91 writes saturday is the day of the week on which the exorcism ought by right to take place because the spirit then rests in this tomb and if he is out on his rambles when the ceremony takes place it is unavailing in most parts of the country as the vampire is regarded as only a nightwanderer he has to be caught during the night between friday and saturday but in some places when he is believed to roam abroad by day as well the whole of saturday is allotted to him for repose and consequently is suitable for his capture p 206 when the stake has been thrust with one drive through the vampires heart his head should be cut off and this is to be done with the sharp edge of a sextons spade rather than with a sword ralston tells us that to transfix the vampire with a pile is not always considered effectual a strigon or istrian vampire who was transfixed with a sharp thorn cudgel near laibach in 1672 pulled it out of his body and flung it back contemptuously the only certain methods of destroying a vampire appear to be either to consume him by fire or to chop off his head with a gravediggers shovel the wends say that if a vampire is hit over the back of the head with an implement of that kind he will squeal like a pig it may be noted that the heads of murderers or warlocks were often struck off and destroyed or else set between the legs or directly underneath the body to burn the body of the vampire is generally acknowledged to be by far the supremely efficacious method of ridding a district of this demoniacal pest and it is the common practice all over the world the bodies of all those whom he may have infected with the vampirish poison by sucking their blood are also for security sake cremated leone allacci writes quare ciues cum uident homines nulla grassante

of these seeking to escape so that he can renew his foul parasitism of death the ashes of the pyre should be scattered to the winds or cast into a river swiftly flowing to the sea sometimes the body was hacked to pieces before it was cast into the fire very often the heart was torn from the breast and boiled to shreds in oil or vinegar quantities of boiling water or boiling oil were also poured into the grave mr abbott in his macedonian folklore 1903 tells us of a p 207 ceremony which took place when a vampire had been tracked he writes i was creditably informed of a case of this description occurring not long ago at alistrati one of the principal villages between serres and drama someone was suspected of having turned into a vampire the corpse was taken out of the grave was scalded with boiling oil and was pierced through the navel with a long nail then the tomb was covered in and millet was scattered over it that if the vampire came out again he might waste his time in picking up the grains of millet and be thus overtaken by dawn for the usual period of their wanderings is from about two hours before midnight till the first crowing of the morning cock at the sound of which fearful summons the vrykolakas like the gaelic sithehe or fairy vanishes into his subterranean abode the turks on occasion have had recourse to the remedy of burning to put to rest a greek vampire for

which infested england in the twelfth century says that similar molestations had often happened and there were on record very many famous cases the only way in which a district could be completely secured and an end put once and for all to these hideous visitations was by exhuming the body and burning the vampire to ashes the following form of exorcism is described as having been employed in rhodes on a woman who returned as a vrykolakas the priest of the village laid on the ground one of the dead womans shifts over the neck of which he walked held up by two men for fear the vampire should seize him while in this position he read verses from the new testament till the shift swelled up and split when this rent takes place the evil spirit is supposed to escape through the opening the first precaution taken by the wallachians to prevent the vampire from ravaging is to drive a long nail through the p 208 skull and to lay the thorny stem of a wild rose bush upon the body so that its winding sheet may become entangled with it should there be any attempt to rise in bulgaria there is yet another method of abolishing a vampirethat of bottling him there are certain persons who make a profession of this and their mode of procedure is as follows the sorcerer armed with a picture of some saint lies in ambush until he sees the vampire pass when he pursues him with his eikon the poor obour takes refuge in a tree or on the roof of a house but his persecutor follows him up with the talisman driving him away from all shelter in the direction of a bottle specially prepared in which is placed some of the vampires favourite food having no other resource he enters this prison and is immediately fastened down with a cork on the interior of which is a fragment of the eikon the bottle is then thrown into the fire and the vampire disappears for ever with reference to this enclosing of the vampire in a bottle it may be remembered that it was once a common practice of sorcery to imprison familiar spirits in a vial among the articles put forth by don alfonso manriquez who on 10 september 1523 succeeded as grand inquisiter adrian bishop of tortosa was the following which a man in duty bound must reveal to the holy office should he become aware of any such offence if any person made or caused to be made mirrors rings phials of glass or other vessels therein to contain some spirit who should reply to his inquiries and aid his projects newton in his travels and discoveries in the levant vol i p 213 says that in mitylene the bodies of those who will not lie quiet in their graves are transported to a small adjacent island a mere eyot without inhabitants where they are reinterred this is an effectual bar to any future molestation for the vampire cannot cross salt water running water too he can only pass at the slack or the flood of the tide as all other demoniacal monsters the vampire fears and shrinks from holy things holy water burns him as some biting acid he flies from the sign of the cross from the crucifix from relics and above all from the host the body of god all these and other hallowed objects render him powerless he is conquered by the fragrance of incense p 209 certain trees and herbs are hateful to him the whitethorn or buckthorn as we have seen and particularly garlic often when the vampire is decapitated his mouth is stuffed full with garlic garlic is scattered in and all over the coffin by handfuls and he can do no harm in china and among the malays to wet a childs forehead with garlic is a sure protection against vampires the west indian negroes today smear themselves with garlic to neutralize the evil charms of witches and obeah men it may be noted that the battas or bataks of sumatra ascribe pining and wasting away sickness terror and death to the absence of the soul tendi from the body and the soul must be lured back to his tenement one of the most powerful soulcompelling herbs which is used by them in their mystic rites on these occasions is garlic 130 at the s john midsummer festival of fire on the vigil of the major solemnity of that saint 23rd june at dragingnan var the people roasted pods of garlic by the bonfires these pods were afterwards distributed to every family and were believed to bring good luck in countries which are nonchristian the practices are naturally somewhat different although it should be remarked that burning the body of the vampire is universal in china corpses suspected of potential vampirism were allowed to decay in the open air before burial or when buried were exhumed as in other countries and cremated in the absence of the corpse from its grave the lid of the coffin was removed since it was thought that the circulation of fresh air would prevent the vampire from returning to it rice red peas and scraps of iron were also scattered round the grave these formed a mystical barrier the dead man could not surmount he fell to the ground stiff and stark and then could be taken up and burned to ashes in some slavonic countries it is thought that a vampire if prowling out of his tomb at night may be shot and killed with a silver bullet that has been blessed by a priest but care must be taken that his body is not laid in the rays of the moon especially if the moon be at her full for in this case he will revive with redoubled vigour and malevolence it should perhaps be mentioned that the macedonians believe in the existence of a vrykolakas of sheep and cattle as well as the more formidable vrykolakas who drains human p 210 blood the vrykolakas of animals rides upon their shoulders and as the ordinary vampire sucks a vein killing the unfortunate beasts and leaving them a mere fibrous mash of skin and bone vagrant mohammedan dervishes profess to have the power of exterminating these inferior vampires whence they are often saluted as vampirekillers and they tramp the countryside ostentatiously exhibiting an iron rod which ends in a sharp point shish to pierce through and destroy the pest or a long lancelike stick furnished at the top with a small axe to strike him down but here we have descended to mere quackery although as we have seen there are many methods and many variants it is certain that an effectual remedy against the vampire is to transfix his heart with a stake driven through with one single blow to strike off his head with a sextons spade and perhaps best of all to burn him to ashes and purge the earth of his pollutions by the incineration of fireembed
